The server certificate entity includes a public key certificate, a private key, and an optional certificate chain, which should all be PEM-encoded. We recommend that you use Certificate Manager to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. With ACM you can request a certificate, deploy it to Amazon Web Services resources, and let ACM handle certificate renewals for you. Certificates provided by ACM are free. For more information about using ACM, see the Certificate Manager User Guide. For more information about working with server certificates, see Working with server certificates in the IAM User Guide. This topic includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM. For information about the number of server certificates you can upload, see IAM and STS quotas in the IAM User Guide.",
