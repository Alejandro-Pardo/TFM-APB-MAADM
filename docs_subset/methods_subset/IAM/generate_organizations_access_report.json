  "description": "Generates a report for service last accessed data for Organizations. You can generate a report for any entities (organization root, organizational unit, or account) or policies in your organization. To call this operation, you must be signed in using your Organizations management account credentials. You can use your long-term IAM user or root user credentials, or temporary credentials from assuming an IAM role. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root. You must have the required IAM and Organizations permissions. For more information, see Refining permissions using service last accessed data in the IAM User Guide. You can generate a service last accessed data report for entities by specifying only the entity's path. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by any service control policies (SCPs) that apply to the entity. You can generate a service last accessed data report for a policy by specifying an entity's path and an optional Organizations policy ID. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service in both report types, the data includes the most recent account activity that the policy allows to account principals in the entity or the entity's children. For important information about the data, reporting period, permissions required, troubleshooting, and supported Regions see Reducing permissions using service last accessed data in the IAM User Guide. This operation returns a JobId. Use this parameter in the GetOrganizationsAccessReport operation to check the status of the report generation. To check the status of this request, use the JobId parameter in the GetOrganizationsAccessReport operation and test the JobStatus response parameter. When the job is complete, you can retrieve the report. To generate a service last accessed data report for entities, specify an entity path without specifying the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned in the report. To generate a service last accessed data report for policies, specify an entity path and the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned for each service. For more information about service last accessed data, see Reducing policy scope by viewing user activity in the IAM User Guide.",
