The regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can include almost any printable ASCII character from the space ( \\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range ( \\u00FF). You can also include the tab ( \\u0009), line feed ( \\u000A), and carriage return ( \\u000D) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password.
