The SSH public keys returned by this operation are used only for authenticating the IAM user to an CodeCommit repository. For more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an CodeCommit repository, see Set up CodeCommit for SSH connections in the CodeCommit User Guide. Although each user is limited to a small number of keys, you can still paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.",
