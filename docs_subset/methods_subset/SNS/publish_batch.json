  "description": "Publishes up to ten messages to the specified topic. This is a batch version of Publish. For FIFO topics, multiple messages within a single batch are published in the order they are sent, and messages are deduplicated within the batch and across batches for 5 minutes. The result of publishing each message is reported individually in the response. Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of 200. The maximum allowed individual message size and the maximum total payload size (the sum of the individual lengths of all of the batched messages) are both 256 KB (262,144 bytes). Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the param.n notation. Values of n are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this: &AttributeName.1=first. &AttributeName.2=second. If you send a batch message to a topic, Amazon SNS publishes the batch message to each endpoint that is subscribed to the topic. The format of the batch message depends on the notification protocol for each subscribed endpoint. When a messageId is returned, the batch message is saved and Amazon SNS immediately delivers the message to subscribers.",

      "description": "A list of PublishBatch request entries to be sent to the SNS topic. (dict) --- Contains the details of a single Amazon SNS message along with an Id that identifies a message within the batch. An identifier for the message in this batch. The body of the message. Subject (string) --- The subject of the batch message. MessageStructure (string) --- Set MessageStructure to json if you want to send a different message for each protocol. For example, using one publish action, you can send a short message to your SMS subscribers and a longer message to your email subscribers. If you set MessageStructure to json, the value of the Message parameter must: be a syntactically valid JSON object; and contain at least a top-level JSON key of 'default' with a value that is a string. You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want to send to a specific transport protocol (e.g. http). MessageAttributes (dict) --- Each message attribute consists of a Name, Type, and Value. For more information, see Amazon SNS message attributes in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide. (string) --- (dict) --- The user-specified message attribute value. For string data types, the value attribute has the same restrictions on the content as the message body. For more information, see Publish. Name, type, and value must not be empty or null. In addition, the message body should not be empty or null. All parts of the message attribute, including name, type, and value, are included in the message size restriction, which is currently 256 KB (262,144 bytes). For more information, see Amazon SNS message attributes and Publishing to a mobile phone in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide. Amazon SNS supports the following logical data types: String, String.Array, Number, and Binary. For more information, see Message Attribute Data Types. StringValue (string) --- Strings are Unicode with UTF8 binary encoding. For a list of code values, see ASCII Printable Characters. BinaryValue (bytes) --- Binary type attributes can store any binary data, for example, compressed data, encrypted data, or images. MessageDeduplicationId (string) --- This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) topics. This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) topics. The MessageDeduplicationId can contain up to 128 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and punctuation (!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~). Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId, which is a token used for deduplication of sent messages within the 5 minute minimum deduplication interval. The scope of deduplication depends on the FifoThroughputScope attribute, when set to Topic the message deduplication scope is across the entire topic, when set to MessageGroup the message deduplication scope is within each individual message group. If a message with a particular MessageDeduplicationId is sent successfully, subsequent messages within the deduplication scope and interval, with the same MessageDeduplicationId, are accepted successfully but aren't delivered. Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId. You may provide a MessageDeduplicationId explicitly. If you aren't able to provide a MessageDeduplicationId and you enable ContentBasedDeduplication for your topic, Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message). If you don't provide a MessageDeduplicationId and the topic doesn't have ContentBasedDeduplication set, the action fails with an error. If the topic has a ContentBasedDeduplication set, your MessageDeduplicationId overrides the generated one. When ContentBasedDeduplication is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication scope and interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. If you send one message with ContentBasedDeduplication enabled, and then another message with a MessageDeduplicationId that is the same as the one generated for the first MessageDeduplicationId, the two messages are treated as duplicates, within the deduplication scope and interval, and only one copy of the message is delivered. MessageGroupId (string) --- This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) topics. The tag that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same message group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different message groups might be processed out of order). To interleave multiple ordered streams within a single topic, use MessageGroupId values (for example, session data for multiple users). In this scenario, multiple consumers can process the topic, but the session data of each user is processed in a FIFO fashion. You must associate a non-empty MessageGroupId with a message. If you don't provide a MessageGroupId, the action fails. The length of MessageGroupId is 128 characters. MessageGroupId can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and punctuation (!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~).",
