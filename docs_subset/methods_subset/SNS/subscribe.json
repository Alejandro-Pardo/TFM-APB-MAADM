The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the Subscribe action uses: DeliveryPolicy --- The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints. FilterPolicy --- The simple JSON object that lets your subscriber receive only a subset of messages, rather than receiving every message published to the topic. FilterPolicyScope --- This attribute lets you choose the filtering scope by using one of the following string value types: MessageAttributes (default) --- The filter is applied on the message attributes. MessageBody --- The filter is applied on the message body. RawMessageDelivery --- When set to true, enables raw message delivery to Amazon SQS or HTTP/S endpoints. This eliminates the need for the endpoints to process JSON formatting, which is otherwise created for Amazon SNS metadata. RedrivePolicy --- When specified, sends undeliverable messages to the specified Amazon SQS dead-letter queue. Messages that can't be delivered due to client errors (for example, when the subscribed endpoint is unreachable) or server errors (for example, when the service that powers the subscribed endpoint becomes unavailable) are held in the dead-letter queue for further analysis or reprocessing. The following attribute applies only to Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream subscriptions: SubscriptionRoleArn --- The ARN of the IAM role that has the following: Permission to write to the Firehose delivery stream Amazon SNS listed as a trusted entity Specifying a valid ARN for this attribute is required for Firehose delivery stream subscriptions. For more information, see Fanout to Firehose delivery streams in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide. The following attributes apply only to FIFO topics: ReplayPolicy --- Adds or updates an inline policy document for a subscription to replay messages stored in the specified Amazon SNS topic. ReplayStatus --- Retrieves the status of the subscription message replay, which can be one of the following: Completed --- The replay has successfully redelivered all messages, and is now delivering newly published messages. If an ending point was specified in the ReplayPolicy then the subscription will no longer receive newly published messages. In progress --- The replay is currently replaying the selected messages. Failed --- The replay was unable to complete. Pending --- The default state while the replay initiates. (string) --- (string) ---",
