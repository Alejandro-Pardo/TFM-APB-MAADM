Valid values are PUT (default), DELETE, and ADD. The behavior depends on whether the specified primary key already exists in the table. If an item with the specified Key is found in the table: PUT - Adds the specified attribute to the item. If the attribute already exists, it is replaced by the new value. DELETE - If no value is specified, the attribute and its value are removed from the item. The data type of the specified value must match the existing value's data type. If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set [a,b,c] and the DELETE action specified [a,c], then the final attribute value would be [b]. Specifying an empty set is an error. ADD - If the attribute does not already exist, then the attribute and its values are added to the item. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of ADD depends on the data type of the attribute: If the existing attribute is a number, and if Value is also a number, then the Value is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If Value is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute. If the existing data type is a set, and if the Value is also a set, then the Value is added to the existing set. (This is a set operation, not mathematical addition.) For example, if the attribute value was the set [1,2], and the ADD action specified [3], then the final attribute value would be [1,2,3]. An error occurs if an Add action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the Value must also be a set of strings. The same holds true for number sets and binary sets. This action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data type is number or is a set. Do not use ADD for any other data types. If no item with the specified Key is found: PUT - DynamoDB creates a new item with the specified primary key, and then adds the attribute. DELETE - Nothing happens; there is no attribute to delete. ADD - DynamoDB creates a new item with the supplied primary key and number (or set) for the attribute value. The only data types allowed are number, number set, string set or binary set.",

(string) --- (dict) --- Represents a condition to be compared with an attribute value. This condition can be used with DeleteItem, PutItem, or UpdateItem operations; if the comparison evaluates to true, the operation succeeds; if not, the operation fails. You can use ExpectedAttributeValue in one of two different ways: Use AttributeValueList to specify one or more values to compare against an attribute. Use ComparisonOperator to specify how you want to perform the comparison. If the comparison evaluates to true, then the conditional operation succeeds. Use Value to specify a value that DynamoDB will compare against an attribute. If the values match, then ExpectedAttributeValue evaluates to true and the conditional operation succeeds. Optionally, you can also set Exists to false, indicating that you do not expect to find the attribute value in the table. In this case, the conditional operation succeeds only if the comparison evaluates to false. Value and Exists are incompatible with AttributeValueList and ComparisonOperator. Note that if you use both sets of parameters at once, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException exception. Value (dict) --- Represents the data for the expected attribute.

For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] (dict) --- Represents the data for an attribute. NULL (boolean) --- An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL (boolean) --- An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true Exists (boolean) --- Causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value before attempting a conditional operation: If Exists is true, DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the operation succeeds. If it is not found, the operation fails with a ConditionCheckFailedException. If Exists is false, DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does not exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the operation succeeds. If the value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the operation fails with a ConditionCheckFailedException. The default setting for Exists is true. If you supply a Value all by itself, DynamoDB assumes the attribute exists: You don't have to set Exists to true, because it is implied. DynamoDB returns a ValidationException if: Exists is true but there is no Value to check. (You expect a value to exist, but don't specify what that value is.) Exists is false but you also provide a Value. (You cannot expect an attribute to have a value, while also expecting it not to exist.) ComparisonOperator (string) --- A comparator for evaluating attributes in the AttributeValueList. For example, equals, greater than, less than, etc. The following comparison operators are available: EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN The following are descriptions of each comparison operator. EQ : Equal. EQ is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {\"S\":\"6\"} does not equal {\"N\":\"6\"}. Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not equal {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}. NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an AttributeValue of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. LE : Less than or equal. AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}. LT : Less than. AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). GE : Greater than or equal. GT : Greater than. NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. NULL : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. CONTAINS : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (' SS', ' NS', or ' BS'), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating ' a CONTAINS b', ' a' can be a list; however, ' b' cannot be a set, a map, or a list. NOT_CONTAINS : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set. If the target attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (' SS', ' NS', or ' BS'), then the operator evaluates to true if it does not find an exact match with any member of the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating ' a NOT CONTAINS b', ' a' can be a list; however, ' b' cannot be a set, a map, or a list. BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix. AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). IN : Checks for matching elements in a list. AttributeValueList can contain one or more AttributeValue elements of type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes are compared against an existing attribute of an item. If any elements of the input are equal to the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true. BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. AttributeValueList must contain two AttributeValue elements of the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second element. For example, {\"S\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"N\":\"6\"}. Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]} AttributeValueList (list) --- One or more values to evaluate against the supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the ComparisonOperator being used. For type Number, value comparisons are numeric. String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a is greater than A, and a is greater than B. For a list of code values, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters. For Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned when it compares binary values. For information on specifying data types in JSON, see JSON Data Format in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. (dict) --- Represents the data for an attribute. For example: \"BOOL\": true.",

The following action values are available for UpdateExpression. SET - Adds one or more attributes and values to an item. If any of these attributes already exist, they are replaced by the new values. You can also use SET to add or subtract from an attribute that is of type Number. For example: SET myNum = myNum + :val SET supports the following functions: if_not_exists (path, operand) - if the item does not contain an attribute at the specified path, then if_not_exists evaluates to operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be present in the item. list_append (operand, operand) - evaluates to a list with a new element added to it. You can append the new element to the start or the end of the list by reversing the order of the operands. These function names are case-sensitive. REMOVE - Removes one or more attributes from an item. ADD - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of ADD depends on the data type of the attribute: If the existing attribute is a number, and if Value is also a number, then Value is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If Value is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute. If the existing data type is a set and if Value is also a set, then Value is added to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set [1,2], and the ADD action specified [3], then the final attribute value is [1,2,3]. An error occurs if an ADD action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the Value must also be a set of strings. DELETE - Deletes an element from a set. If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set [a,b,c] and the DELETE action specifies [a,c], then the final attribute value is [b]. Specifying an empty set is an error. You can have many actions in a single expression, such as the following: SET a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4, :value5 For more information on update expressions, see Modifying Items and Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.",
