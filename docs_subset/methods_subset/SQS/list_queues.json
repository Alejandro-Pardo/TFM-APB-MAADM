If you specify a value for the optional QueueNamePrefix parameter, only queues with a name that begins with the specified value are returned. The listQueues methods supports pagination. Set parameter MaxResults in the request to specify the maximum number of results to be returned in the response. If you do not set MaxResults, the response includes a maximum of 1,000 results. If you set MaxResults and there are additional results to display, the response includes a value for NextToken. Use NextToken as a parameter in your next request to listQueues to receive the next page of results.",
