  "description": "Disassociates secondary Elastic IP addresses (EIPs) from a public NAT gateway. You cannot disassociate your primary EIP. For more information, see Edit secondary IP address associations in the Amazon VPC User Guide. While disassociating is in progress, you cannot associate/disassociate additional EIPs while the connections are being drained. You are, however, allowed to delete the NAT gateway. An EIP is released only at the end of MaxDrainDurationSeconds. It stays associated and supports the existing connections but does not support any new connections (new connections are distributed across the remaining associated EIPs). As the existing connections drain out, the EIPs (and the corresponding private IP addresses mapped to them) are released.",
