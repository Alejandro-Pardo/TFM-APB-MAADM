Amazon Web Services accounts, organizations, and Organizational Units that lost access to the AMI when it was disabled do not regain access automatically. Once the AMI is available, it can be shared with them again. Only the AMI owner can re-enable a disabled AMI. For more information, see Disable an AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.",
