      "description": "Describes the configuration of Spot Instances in an EC2 Fleet. AllocationStrategy (string) --- The strategy that determines how to allocate the target Spot Instance capacity across the Spot Instance pools specified by the EC2 Fleet launch configuration. For more information, see Allocation strategies for Spot Instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. price-capacity-optimized (recommended) EC2 Fleet identifies the pools with the highest capacity availability for the number of instances that are launching. This means that we will request Spot Instances from the pools that we believe have the lowest chance of interruption in the near term. EC2 Fleet then requests Spot Instances from the lowest priced of these pools. capacity-optimized EC2 Fleet identifies the pools with the highest capacity availability for the number of instances that are launching. To give certain instance types a higher chance of launching first, use capacity-optimized-prioritized. Set a priority for each instance type by using the Priority parameter for LaunchTemplateOverrides. You can assign the same priority to different LaunchTemplateOverrides. EC2 implements the priorities on a best-effort basis, but optimizes for capacity first. capacity-optimized-prioritized is supported only if your EC2 Fleet uses a launch template. Note that if the On-Demand AllocationStrategy is set to prioritized, the same priority is applied when fulfilling On-Demand capacity. diversified EC2 Fleet requests instances from all of the Spot Instance pools that you specify. lowest-price (not recommended) EC2 Fleet requests instances from the lowest priced Spot Instance pool that has available capacity. If the lowest priced pool doesn't have available capacity, the Spot Instances come from the next lowest priced pool that has available capacity. If a pool runs out of capacity before fulfilling your desired capacity, EC2 Fleet will continue to fulfill your request by drawing from the next lowest priced pool. To ensure that your desired capacity is met, you might receive Spot Instances from several pools. Because this strategy only considers instance price and not capacity availability, it might lead to high interruption rates. Default: lowest-price MaintenanceStrategies (dict) --- The strategies for managing your Spot Instances that are at an elevated risk of being interrupted. CapacityRebalance (dict) --- The strategy to use when Amazon EC2 emits a signal that your Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of being interrupted. ReplacementStrategy (string) --- The replacement strategy to use. Only available for fleets of type maintain. launch - EC2 Fleet launches a replacement Spot Instance when a rebalance notification is emitted for an existing Spot Instance in the fleet. EC2 Fleet does not terminate the instances that receive a rebalance notification. You can terminate the old instances, or you can leave them running. You are charged for all instances while they are running. launch-before-terminate - EC2 Fleet launches a replacement Spot Instance when a rebalance notification is emitted for an existing Spot Instance in the fleet, and then, after a delay that you specify (in TerminationDelay), terminates the instances that received a rebalance notification. TerminationDelay (integer) --- The amount of time (in seconds) that Amazon EC2 waits before terminating the old Spot Instance after launching a new replacement Spot Instance. Required when ReplacementStrategy is set to launch-before-terminate. Not valid when ReplacementStrategy is set to launch. Valid values: Minimum value of 120 seconds. Maximum value of 7200 seconds. InstanceInterruptionBehavior (string) --- The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted. Default: terminate InstancePoolsToUseCount (integer) --- The number of Spot pools across which to allocate your target Spot capacity. Supported only when Spot AllocationStrategy is set to lowest-price. EC2 Fleet selects the cheapest Spot pools and evenly allocates your target Spot capacity across the number of Spot pools that you specify. Note that EC2 Fleet attempts to draw Spot Instances from the number of pools that you specify on a best effort basis. If a pool runs out of Spot capacity before fulfilling your target capacity, EC2 Fleet will continue to fulfill your request by drawing from the next cheapest pool. To ensure that your target capacity is met, you might receive Spot Instances from more than the number of pools that you specified. Similarly, if most of the pools have no Spot capacity, you might receive your full target capacity from fewer than the number of pools that you specified. SingleInstanceType (boolean) --- Indicates that the fleet uses a single instance type to launch all Spot Instances in the fleet. Supported only for fleets of type instant. SingleAvailabilityZone (boolean) --- Indicates that the fleet launches all Spot Instances into a single Availability Zone. MinTargetCapacity (integer) --- The minimum target capacity for Spot Instances in the fleet. If this minimum capacity isn't reached, no instances are launched. Constraints: Maximum value of 1000. At least one of the following must be specified: SingleAvailabilityZone | SingleInstanceType MaxTotalPrice (string) --- The maximum amount per hour for Spot Instances that you're willing to pay.

      "description": "The configuration for the EC2 Fleet. (dict) --- Describes a launch template and overrides. LaunchTemplateSpecification (dict) --- The launch template to use. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request. LaunchTemplateId (string) --- The ID of the launch template. You must specify the LaunchTemplateId or the LaunchTemplateName, but not both. LaunchTemplateName (string) --- The name of the launch template. You must specify the LaunchTemplateName or the LaunchTemplateId, but not both. Version (string) --- The launch template version number, $Latest, or $Default. You must specify a value, otherwise the request fails. If the value is $Latest, Amazon EC2 uses the latest version of the launch template. If the value is $Default, Amazon EC2 uses the default version of the launch template. Overrides (list) --- Any parameters that you specify override the same parameters in the launch template. For fleets of type request and maintain, a maximum of 300 items is allowed across all launch templates. (dict) --- Describes overrides for a launch template. InstanceType (string) --- The instance type. mac1.metal is not supported as a launch template override. MaxPrice (string) --- The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance. We do not recommend using this parameter because it can lead to increased interruptions. If you do not specify this parameter, you will pay the current Spot price. SubnetId (string) --- The IDs of the subnets in which to launch the instances. Separate multiple subnet IDs using commas (for example, subnet-1234abcdeexample1, subnet-0987cdef6example2). A request of type instant can have only one subnet ID. AvailabilityZone (string) --- The Availability Zone in which to launch the instances. WeightedCapacity (float) --- The number of units provided by the specified instance type. These are the same units that you chose to set the target capacity in terms of instances, or a performance characteristic such as vCPUs, memory, or I/O. If the target capacity divided by this value is not a whole number, Amazon EC2 rounds the number of instances to the next whole number. If this value is not specified, the default is 1. Priority (float) --- The priority for the launch template override. The highest priority is launched first. If the On-Demand AllocationStrategy is set to prioritized, EC2 Fleet uses priority to determine which launch template override to use first in fulfilling On-Demand capacity. If the Spot AllocationStrategy is set to capacity-optimized-prioritized, EC2 Fleet uses priority on a best-effort basis to determine which launch template override to use in fulfilling Spot capacity, but optimizes for capacity first. Valid values are whole numbers starting at 0. The lower the number, the higher the priority. If no number is set, the launch template override has the lowest priority. You can set the same priority for different launch template overrides. Placement (dict) --- The location where the instance launched, if applicable. Affinity (string) --- The affinity setting for the instance on the Dedicated Host. This parameter is not supported for CreateFleet or ImportInstance. GroupName (string) --- The name of the placement group that the instance is in. If you specify GroupName, you can't specify GroupId. PartitionNumber (integer) --- The number of the partition that the instance is in. Valid only if the placement group strategy is set to partition. This parameter is not supported for CreateFleet. HostId (string) --- The ID of the Dedicated Host on which the instance resides. Tenancy (string) --- The tenancy of the instance. An instance with a tenancy of dedicated runs on single-tenant hardware. The host tenancy is not supported for ImportInstance or for T3 instances that are configured for the unlimited CPU credit option. SpreadDomain (string) --- Reserved for future use. HostResourceGroupArn (string) --- The ARN of the host resource group in which to launch the instances. If you specify this parameter, either omit the Tenancy parameter or set it to host. GroupId (string) --- The ID of the placement group that the instance is in. If you specify GroupId, you can't specify GroupName. AvailabilityZone (string) --- The Availability Zone of the instance. If not specified, an Availability Zone will be automatically chosen for you based on the load balancing criteria for the Region. BlockDeviceMappings (list) --- The block device mappings, which define the EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to the instance at launch. Supported only for fleets of type instant. For more information, see Block device mappings for volumes on Amazon EC2 instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. (dict) --- Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch. To override a block device mapping specified in the launch template: Specify the exact same DeviceName here as specified in the launch template. Only specify the parameters you want to change. Any parameters you don't specify here will keep their original launch template values. To add a new block device mapping: Specify a DeviceName that doesn't exist in the launch template. Specify all desired parameters here. DeviceName (string) --- The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh). VirtualName (string) --- The virtual device name ( ephemeralN). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1. The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume. NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect. Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI. Ebs (dict) --- Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched. Encrypted (boolean) --- Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EBS User Guide. In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume. Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see Supported instance types. This parameter is not returned by DescribeImageAttribute. For CreateImage and RegisterImage, whether you can include this parameter, and the allowed values differ depending on the type of block device mapping you are creating. If you are creating a block device mapping for a new (empty) volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true for an encrypted volume, or false for an unencrypted volume. If you omit this parameter, it defaults to false (unencrypted). If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted or unencrypted snapshot, you must omit this parameter. If you include this parameter, the request will fail, regardless of the value that you specify. If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing unencrypted volume, you can include this parameter, but you must specify false. If you specify true, the request will fail. In this case, we recommend that you omit the parameter. If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true or false. However, if you specify false, the parameter is ignored and the block device mapping is always encrypted. DeleteOnTermination (boolean) --- Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see Preserve data when an instance is terminated in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Iops (integer) --- The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3, io1, and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting. The following are the supported values for each volume type: gp3: 3,000 - 16,000 IOPS io1: 100 - 64,000 IOPS io2: 100 - 256,000 IOPS For io2 volumes, you can achieve up to 256,000 IOPS on instances built on the Nitro System. On other instances, you can achieve performance up to 32,000 IOPS. This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. Throughput (integer) --- The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s. This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes. Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000. KmsKeyId (string) --- Identifier (key ID, key alias, key ARN, or alias ARN) of the customer managed KMS key to use for EBS encryption. This parameter is only supported on BlockDeviceMapping objects called by CreateFleet, RequestSpotInstances, and RunInstances. SnapshotId (string) --- The ID of the snapshot. VolumeSize (integer) --- The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size. The following are the supported sizes for each volume type: gp2 and gp3: 1 - 16,384 GiB io1: 4 - 16,384 GiB io2: 4 - 65,536 GiB st1 and sc1: 125 - 16,384 GiB standard: 1 - 1024 GiB VolumeType (string) --- The volume type. For more information, see Amazon EBS volume types in the Amazon EBS User Guide. NoDevice (string) --- To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify an empty string. When this property is specified, the device is removed from the block device mapping regardless of the assigned value. InstanceRequirements (dict) --- The attributes for the instance types. When you specify instance attributes, Amazon EC2 will identify instance types with those attributes. The minimum and maximum number of vCPUs. The minimum number of vCPUs. To specify no minimum limit, specify 0. Max (integer) --- The maximum number of vCPUs. To specify no maximum limit, omit this parameter. The minimum and maximum amount of memory, in MiB. The minimum amount of memory, in MiB. Max (integer) --- The maximum amount of memory, in MiB. CpuManufacturers (list) --- The CPU manufacturers to include. For instance types with Intel CPUs, specify intel. For instance types with AMD CPUs, specify amd. For instance types with Amazon Web Services CPUs, specify amazon-web-services. For instance types with Apple CPUs, specify apple. Default: Any manufacturer (string) --- MemoryGiBPerVCpu (dict) --- The minimum and maximum amount of memory per vCPU, in GiB. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (float) --- The minimum amount of memory per vCPU, in GiB. To specify no minimum limit, omit this parameter. Max (float) --- The maximum amount of memory per vCPU, in GiB. ExcludedInstanceTypes (list) --- The instance types to exclude. You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk ( *), to exclude an instance family, type, size, or generation. The following are examples: m5.8xlarge, c5*.*, m5a.*, r*, *3*. For example, if you specify c5*,Amazon EC2 will exclude the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 will exclude all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: No excluded instance types (string) --- InstanceGenerations (list) --- Indicates whether current or previous generation instance types are included. The current generation instance types are recommended for use. Current generation instance types are typically the latest two to three generations in each instance family. For more information, see Instance types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. For current generation instance types, specify current. For previous generation instance types, specify previous. Default: Current and previous generation instance types (string) --- SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice (integer) --- [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified Spot price. The identified Spot price is the Spot price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified Spot price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, and failing that, from the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. When Amazon EC2 selects instance types with your attributes, it will exclude instance types whose Spot price exceeds your specified threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 interprets as a percentage. If you set TargetCapacityUnitType to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is applied based on the per-vCPU or per-memory price instead of the per-instance price. This parameter is not supported for GetSpotPlacementScores and GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements. Default: 100 OnDemandMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice (integer) --- [Price protection] The price protection threshold for On-Demand Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified On-Demand price. The identified On-Demand price is the price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes.

For instance types with Inference accelerators, specify inference. Default: Any accelerator type (string) --- AcceleratorCount (dict) --- The minimum and maximum number of accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs, or Amazon Web Services Inferentia chips) on an instance. To exclude accelerator-enabled instance types, set Max to 0. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (integer) --- The minimum number of accelerators. Max (integer) --- The maximum number of accelerators. AcceleratorManufacturers (list) --- Indicates whether instance types must have accelerators by specific manufacturers. For instance types with Amazon Web Services devices, specify amazon-web-services. For instance types with AMD devices, specify amd. For instance types with Habana devices, specify habana. For instance types with NVIDIA devices, specify nvidia. For instance types with Xilinx devices, specify xilinx. Default: Any manufacturer (string) --- AcceleratorNames (list) --- The accelerators that must be on the instance type. For instance types with NVIDIA A10G GPUs, specify a10g.

For more information, see Amazon EC2 instance network bandwidth in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (float) --- The minimum amount of network bandwidth, in Gbps. Max (float) --- The maximum amount of network bandwidth, in Gbps. AllowedInstanceTypes (list) --- The instance types to apply your specified attributes against. All other instance types are ignored, even if they match your specified attributes. You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk ( *), to allow an instance type, size, or generation. For example, if you specify c5*,Amazon EC2 will allow the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 will allow all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: All instance types (string) --- MaxSpotPriceAsPercentageOfOptimalOnDemandPrice (integer) --- [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage of an identified On-Demand price. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, and failing that, from the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. If you set TargetCapacityUnitType to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is based on the per vCPU or per memory price instead of the per instance price. BaselinePerformanceFactors (dict) --- The baseline performance to consider, using an instance family as a baseline reference. The instance family establishes the lowest acceptable level of performance. Amazon EC2 uses this baseline to guide instance type selection, but there is no guarantee that the selected instance types will always exceed the baseline for every application. Currently, this parameter only supports CPU performance as a baseline performance factor. For more information, see Performance protection in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Cpu (dict) --- The CPU performance to consider, using an instance family as the baseline reference. References (list) --- Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture differences. (dict) --- Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture.

The following instance families are not supported for performance protection: c1 g3 | g3s hpc7g m1 | m2 mac1 | mac2 | mac2-m1ultra | mac2-m2 | mac2-m2pro p3dn | p4d | p5 t1 u-12tb1 | u-18tb1 | u-24tb1 | u-3tb1 | u-6tb1 | u-9tb1 | u7i-12tb | u7in-16tb | u7in-24tb | u7in-32tb If you enable performance protection by specifying a supported instance family, the returned instance types will exclude the above unsupported instance families. If you specify an unsupported instance family as a value for baseline performance, the API returns an empty response for GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements and an exception for CreateFleet, RequestSpotFleet, ModifyFleet, and ModifySpotFleetRequest. ImageId (string) --- The ID of the AMI in the format ami-17characters00000. Alternatively, you can specify a Systems Manager parameter, using one of the following formats. The Systems Manager parameter will resolve to an AMI ID on launch. To reference a public parameter: resolve:ssm:public-parameter To reference a parameter stored in the same account: resolve:ssm:parameter-name resolve:ssm:parameter-name:version-number resolve:ssm:parameter-name:label To reference a parameter shared from another Amazon Web Services account: resolve:ssm:parameter-ARN resolve:ssm:parameter-ARN:version-number resolve:ssm:parameter-ARN:label For more information, see Use a Systems Manager parameter instead of an AMI ID in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.",
