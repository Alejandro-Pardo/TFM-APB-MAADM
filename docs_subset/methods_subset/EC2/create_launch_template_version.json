Launch templates are immutable; after you create a launch template, you can't modify it. Instead, you can create a new version of the launch template that includes the changes that you require.

If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 will allow all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: All instance types (string) --- MaxSpotPriceAsPercentageOfOptimalOnDemandPrice (integer) --- [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage of an identified On-Demand price. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, and failing that, from the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. If you set TargetCapacityUnitType to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is based on the per vCPU or per memory price instead of the per instance price. BaselinePerformanceFactors (dict) --- The baseline performance to consider, using an instance family as a baseline reference. The instance family establishes the lowest acceptable level of performance. Amazon EC2 uses this baseline to guide instance type selection, but there is no guarantee that the selected instance types will always exceed the baseline for every application. Currently, this parameter only supports CPU performance as a baseline performance factor. For more information, see Performance protection in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Cpu (dict) --- The CPU performance to consider, using an instance family as the baseline reference. References (list) --- Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture differences. (dict) --- Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture. InstanceFamily (string) --- The instance family to use as a baseline reference. The following instance families are not supported for performance protection: c1 g3 | g3s hpc7g m1 | m2 mac1 | mac2 | mac2-m1ultra | mac2-m2 | mac2-m2pro p3dn | p4d | p5 t1 u-12tb1 | u-18tb1 | u-24tb1 | u-3tb1 | u-6tb1 | u-9tb1 | u7i-12tb | u7in-16tb | u7in-24tb | u7in-32tb If you enable performance protection by specifying a supported instance family, the returned instance types will exclude the above unsupported instance families. If you specify an unsupported instance family as a value for baseline performance, the API returns an empty response for GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements and an exception for CreateFleet, RequestSpotFleet, ModifyFleet, and ModifySpotFleetRequest. PrivateDnsNameOptions (dict) --- The options for the instance hostname. The default values are inherited from the subnet. HostnameType (string) --- The type of hostname for Amazon EC2 instances. For IPv4 only subnets, an instance DNS name must be based on the instance IPv4 address. For IPv6 native subnets, an instance DNS name must be based on the instance ID. For dual-stack subnets, you can specify whether DNS names use the instance IPv4 address or the instance ID. EnableResourceNameDnsARecord (boolean) --- Indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames with DNS A records. EnableResourceNameDnsAAAARecord (boolean) --- Indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames with DNS AAAA records. MaintenanceOptions (dict) --- The maintenance options for the instance. AutoRecovery (string) --- Disables the automatic recovery behavior of your instance or sets it to default. For more information, see Simplified automatic recovery. DisableApiStop (boolean) --- Indicates whether to enable the instance for stop protection. For more information, see Enable stop protection for your EC2 instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Operator (dict) --- The entity that manages the launch template. Principal (string) --- The service provider that manages the resource. NetworkPerformanceOptions (dict) --- Contains launch template settings to boost network performance for the type of workload that runs on your instance. BandwidthWeighting (string) --- Specify the bandwidth weighting option to boost the associated type of baseline bandwidth, as follows: default This option uses the standard bandwidth configuration for your instance type. vpc-1 This option boosts your networking baseline bandwidth and reduces your EBS baseline bandwidth. ebs-1 This option boosts your EBS baseline bandwidth and reduces your networking baseline bandwidth.",
