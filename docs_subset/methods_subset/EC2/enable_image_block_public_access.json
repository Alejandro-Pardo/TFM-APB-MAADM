  "description": "Enables block public access for AMIs at the account level in the specified Amazon Web Services Region. This prevents the public sharing of your AMIs. However, if you already have public AMIs, they will remain publicly available. The API can take up to 10 minutes to configure this setting. During this time, if you run GetImageBlockPublicAccessState, the response will be unblocked. When the API has completed the configuration, the response will be block-new-sharing. For more information, see Block public access to your AMIs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.",
