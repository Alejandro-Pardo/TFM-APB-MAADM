  "description": "Associates an Elastic IP address, or carrier IP address (for instances that are in subnets in Wavelength Zones) with an instance or a network interface. Before you can use an Elastic IP address, you must allocate it to your account. If the Elastic IP address is already associated with a different instance, it is disassociated from that instance and associated with the specified instance. If you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance that has an existing Elastic IP address, the existing address is disassociated from the instance, but remains allocated to your account. [Subnets in Wavelength Zones] You can associate an IP address from the telecommunication carrier to the instance or network interface. You cannot associate an Elastic IP address with an interface in a different network border group.",
