The operation succeeds if the instances are valid and belong to you. Requests to reboot terminated instances are ignored. If an instance does not cleanly shut down within a few minutes, Amazon EC2 performs a hard reboot. For more information about troubleshooting, see Troubleshoot an unreachable instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.",
