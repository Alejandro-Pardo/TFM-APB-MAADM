  "description": "Cancels the specified Capacity Reservation, releases the reserved capacity, and changes the Capacity Reservation's state to cancelled. You can cancel a Capacity Reservation that is in the following states: If a future-dated Capacity Reservation enters the delayed state, the commitment duration is waived, and you can cancel it as soon as it enters the active state. Instances running in the reserved capacity continue running until you stop them. Stopped instances that target the Capacity Reservation can no longer launch. Modify these instances to either target a different Capacity Reservation, launch On-Demand Instance capacity, or run in any open Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes and sufficient capacity.",
