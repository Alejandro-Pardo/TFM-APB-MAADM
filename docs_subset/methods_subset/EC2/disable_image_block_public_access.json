  "description": "Disables block public access for AMIs at the account level in the specified Amazon Web Services Region. This removes the block public access restriction from your account. With the restriction removed, you can publicly share your AMIs in the specified Amazon Web Services Region. The API can take up to 10 minutes to configure this setting. During this time, if you run GetImageBlockPublicAccessState, the response will be block-new-sharing. When the API has completed the configuration, the response will be unblocked. For more information, see Block public access to your AMIs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.",
