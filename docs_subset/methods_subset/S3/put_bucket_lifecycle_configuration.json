  "description": "Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the bucket or replaces an existing lifecycle configuration. Keep in mind that this will overwrite an existing lifecycle configuration, so if you want to retain any configuration details, they must be included in the new lifecycle configuration. For information about lifecycle configuration, see Managing your storage lifecycle. You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The lifecycle configuration is specified as XML consisting of one or more rules. An Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration can have up to 1,000 rules. This limit is not adjustable. Bucket lifecycle configuration supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, object size, or any combination of these. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API. The previous version of the API supported filtering based only on an object key name prefix, which is supported for backward compatibility for general purpose buckets. For the related API description, see PutBucketLifecycle. A lifecycle rule consists of the following: For more information, see Object Lifecycle Management and Lifecycle Configuration Elements. Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is s3express-control.region.amazonaws.com. The following operations are related to PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration:",

      "description": "Container for lifecycle rules. You can add as many as 1,000 rules. A lifecycle rule for individual objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. (dict) --- A lifecycle rule for individual objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information see, Managing your storage lifecycle in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Expiration (dict) --- Specifies the expiration for the lifecycle of the object in the form of date, days and, whether the object has a delete marker. Date (datetime) --- Indicates at what date the object is to be moved or deleted. The date value must conform to the ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight UTC. Days (integer) --- Indicates the lifetime, in days, of the objects that are subject to the rule. The value must be a non-zero positive integer. ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker (boolean) --- Indicates whether Amazon S3 will remove a delete marker with no noncurrent versions. If set to true, the delete marker will be expired; if set to false the policy takes no action. This cannot be specified with Days or Date in a Lifecycle Expiration Policy. ID (string) --- Unique identifier for the rule. The value cannot be longer than 255 characters. Prefix (string) --- Prefix identifying one or more objects to which the rule applies. This is no longer used; use Filter instead. Filter (dict) --- The Filter is used to identify objects that a Lifecycle Rule applies to. A Filter must have exactly one of Prefix, Tag, ObjectSizeGreaterThan, ObjectSizeLessThan, or And specified. Filter is required if the LifecycleRule does not contain a Prefix element. For more information about Tag filters, see Adding filters to Lifecycle rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Tag (dict) --- This tag must exist in the object's tag set in order for the rule to apply. Name of the object key. Value of the tag. ObjectSizeGreaterThan (integer) --- Minimum object size to which the rule applies. ObjectSizeLessThan (integer) --- Maximum object size to which the rule applies. And (dict) --- This is used in a Lifecycle Rule Filter to apply a logical AND to two or more predicates. The Lifecycle Rule will apply to any object matching all of the predicates configured inside the And operator. Tags (list) --- All of these tags must exist in the object's tag set in order for the rule to apply. (dict) --- A container of a key value name pair. If --\u0098Enabled', the rule is currently being applied. If --\u0098Disabled', the rule is not currently being applied. Transitions (list) --- Specifies when an Amazon S3 object transitions to a specified storage class. (dict) --- Specifies when an object transitions to a specified storage class. For more information about Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration rules, see Transitioning Objects Using Amazon S3 Lifecycle in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Date (datetime) --- Indicates when objects are transitioned to the specified storage class. The date value must be in ISO 8601 format. Days (integer) --- Indicates the number of days after creation when objects are transitioned to the specified storage class. If the specified storage class is INTELLIGENT_TIERING, GLACIER_IR, GLACIER, or DEEP_ARCHIVE, valid values are 0 or positive integers. If the specified storage class is STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA, valid values are positive integers greater than 30. Be aware that some storage classes have a minimum storage duration and that you're charged for transitioning objects before their minimum storage duration. For more information, see Constraints and considerations for transitions in the Amazon S3 User Guide. StorageClass (string) --- The storage class to which you want the object to transition. NoncurrentVersionTransitions (list) --- Specifies the transition rule for the lifecycle rule that describes when noncurrent objects transition to a specific storage class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled (or versioning is suspended), you can set this action to request that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent object versions to a specific storage class at a set period in the object's lifetime. (dict) --- Container for the transition rule that describes when noncurrent objects transition to the STANDARD_IA, ONEZONE_IA, INTELLIGENT_TIERING, GLACIER_IR, GLACIER, or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled (or versioning is suspended), you can set this action to request that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent object versions to the STANDARD_IA, ONEZONE_IA, INTELLIGENT_TIERING, GLACIER_IR, GLACIER, or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class at a specific period in the object's lifetime. NoncurrentDays (integer) --- Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent before Amazon S3 can perform the associated action. For information about the noncurrent days calculations, see How Amazon S3 Calculates How Long an Object Has Been Noncurrent in the Amazon S3 User Guide. StorageClass (string) --- The class of storage used to store the object. NewerNoncurrentVersions (integer) --- Specifies how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3 will retain in the same storage class before transitioning objects. You can specify up to 100 noncurrent versions to retain. Amazon S3 will transition any additional noncurrent versions beyond the specified number to retain. For more information about noncurrent versions, see Lifecycle configuration elements in the Amazon S3 User Guide. NoncurrentVersionExpiration (dict) --- Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon expiration, Amazon S3 permanently deletes the noncurrent object versions. You set this lifecycle configuration action on a bucket that has versioning enabled (or suspended) to request that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent object versions at a specific period in the object's lifetime. For information about the noncurrent days calculations, see How Amazon S3 Calculates When an Object Became Noncurrent in the Amazon S3 User Guide. NewerNoncurrentVersions (integer) --- Specifies how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3 will retain. Amazon S3 will permanently delete any additional noncurrent versions beyond the specified number to retain. AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload (dict) --- Specifies the days since the initiation of an incomplete multipart upload that Amazon S3 will wait before permanently removing all parts of the upload. For more information, see Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Configuration in the Amazon S3 User Guide. DaysAfterInitiation (integer) --- Specifies the number of days after which Amazon S3 aborts an incomplete multipart upload.",
