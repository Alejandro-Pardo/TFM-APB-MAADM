  "description": "This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead. The request can contain a list of up to 1,000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete operation and returns the result of that delete, success or failure, in the response. If the object specified in the request isn't found, Amazon S3 confirms the deletion by returning the result as deleted. The operation supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion in a quiet mode, the operation does not return any information about the delete in the response body. When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see MFA Delete in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. The following operations are related to DeleteObjects:",

      "description": "The bucket name containing the objects to delete. Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3 (for example, amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Access points - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User Guide.",
