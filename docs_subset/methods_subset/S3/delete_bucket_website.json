  "description": "This action removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3 returns a 200 OK response upon successfully deleting a website configuration on the specified bucket. You will get a 200 OK response if the website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a 404 response if the bucket specified in the request does not exist. This DELETE action requires the S3:DeleteBucketWebsite permission. By default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the S3:DeleteBucketWebsite permission. For more information about hosting websites, see Hosting Websites on Amazon S3. The following operations are related to DeleteBucketWebsite:",
