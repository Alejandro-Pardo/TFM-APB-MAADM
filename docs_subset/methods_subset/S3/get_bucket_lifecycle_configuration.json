Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, object size, or any combination of these. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API, which is compatible with the new functionality. The previous version of the API supported filtering based only on an object key name prefix, which is supported for general purpose buckets for backward compatibility. For the related API description, see GetBucketLifecycle. Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is s3express-control.region.amazonaws.com.
