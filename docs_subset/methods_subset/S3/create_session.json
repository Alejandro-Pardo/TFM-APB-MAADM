  "description": "Creates a session that establishes temporary security credentials to support fast authentication and authorization for the Zonal endpoint API operations on directory buckets. For more information about Zonal endpoint API operations that include the Availability Zone in the request endpoint, see S3 Express One Zone APIs in the Amazon S3 User Guide. To make Zonal endpoint API requests on a directory bucket, use the CreateSession API operation. Specifically, you grant s3express:CreateSession permission to a bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you use IAM credentials to make the CreateSession API request on the bucket, which returns temporary security credentials that include the access key ID, secret access key, session token, and expiration. These credentials have associated permissions to access the Zonal endpoint API operations. After the session is created, you don't need to use other policies to grant permissions to each Zonal endpoint API individually. Instead, in your Zonal endpoint API requests, you sign your requests by applying the temporary security credentials of the session to the request headers and following the SigV4 protocol for authentication. You also apply the session token to the x-amz-s3session-token request header for authorization. Temporary security credentials are scoped to the bucket and expire after 5 minutes. After the expiration time, any calls that you make with those credentials will fail. You must use IAM credentials again to make a CreateSession API request that generates a new set of temporary credentials for use. Temporary credentials cannot be extended or refreshed beyond the original specified interval. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to initiate and manage requests to the CreateSession API. For more information, see Performance guidelines and design patterns in the Amazon S3 User Guide. To obtain temporary security credentials, you must create a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy that grants s3express:CreateSession permission to the bucket. In a policy, you can have the s3express:SessionMode condition key to control who can create a ReadWrite or ReadOnly session. For more information about ReadWrite or ReadOnly sessions, see x-amz-create-session-mode. For example policies, see Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone and Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide. To grant cross-account access to Zonal endpoint API operations, the bucket policy should also grant both accounts the s3express:CreateSession permission. If you want to encrypt objects with SSE-KMS, you must also have the kms:GenerateDataKey and the kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the target KMS key. For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) ( AES256) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) ( aws:kms). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads. For Zonal endpoint (object-level) API operations except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy, you authenticate and authorize requests through CreateSession for low latency. To encrypt new objects in a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, you must specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a customer managed key). Then, when a session is created for Zonal endpoint API operations, new objects are automatically encrypted and decrypted with SSE-KMS and S3 Bucket Keys during the session. In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy) using the REST API, you can't override the values of the encryption settings ( x-amz-server-side-encryption, x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, x-amz-server-side-encryption-context, and x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled) from the CreateSession request. You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the CreateSession request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.
