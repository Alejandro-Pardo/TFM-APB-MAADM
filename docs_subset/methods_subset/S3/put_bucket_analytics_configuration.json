  "description": "Sets an analytics configuration for the bucket (specified by the analytics configuration ID). You can have up to 1,000 analytics configurations per bucket. You can choose to have storage class analysis export analysis reports sent to a comma-separated values (CSV) flat file. See the DataExport request element. Reports are updated daily and are based on the object filters that you configure. When selecting data export, you specify a destination bucket and an optional destination prefix where the file is written. You can export the data to a destination bucket in a different account. However, the destination bucket must be in the same Region as the bucket that you are making the PUT analytics configuration to. For more information, see Amazon S3 Analytics --- Storage Class Analysis. To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:PutAnalyticsConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources. PutBucketAnalyticsConfiguration has the following special errors: The following operations are related to PutBucketAnalyticsConfiguration:",
