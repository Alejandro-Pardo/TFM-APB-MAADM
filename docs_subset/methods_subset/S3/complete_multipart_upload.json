  "description": "Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts. You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the UploadPart operation or the UploadPartCopy operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this CompleteMultipartUpload operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the CompleteMultipartUpload request, you must provide the parts list and ensure that the parts list is complete. The CompleteMultipartUpload API operation concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the PartNumber value and the ETag value that are returned after that part was uploaded. The processing of a CompleteMultipartUpload request could take several minutes to finalize. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. A request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent. This means that a 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error. The error response might be embedded in the 200 OK response. If you call this API operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions, they return an error). Note that if CompleteMultipartUpload fails, applications should be prepared to retry any failed requests (including 500 error responses). For more information, see Amazon S3 Error Best Practices. For more information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. The following operations are related to CompleteMultipartUpload:",

      "description": "Name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated. Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3 (for example, amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Access points - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User Guide.",
