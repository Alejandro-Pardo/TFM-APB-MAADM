  "description": "Uses the acl subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for a new or existing object in an S3 bucket. You must have the WRITE_ACP permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information, see What permissions can I grant? in the Amazon S3 User Guide. This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts. Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can continue to use that approach. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide. You can set access permissions using one of the following methods: For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants list objects permission to the two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses. x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress=\"xyz@amazon.com\", emailAddress=\"abc@amazon.com\" You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both. You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways. For examples of how to specify these grantee values in JSON format, see the Amazon Web Services CLI example in Enabling Amazon S3 server access logging in the Amazon S3 User Guide. The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT sets the ACL of the current version of an object. To set the ACL of a different version, use the versionId subresource. The following operations are related to PutObjectAcl:",
