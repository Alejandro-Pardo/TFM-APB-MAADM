  "description": "You can use this operation to determine if a bucket exists and if you have permission to access it. The action returns a 200 OK if the bucket exists and you have permission to access it. General purpose buckets - Request to public buckets that grant the s3:ListBucket permission publicly do not need to be signed. All other HeadBucket requests must be authenticated and signed by using IAM credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the IAM identities). All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source, must be signed. For more information, see REST Authentication. Directory buckets - You must use IAM credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the HeadBucket API operation, instead of using the temporary security credentials through the CreateSession API operation. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your behalf. Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com.",

      "description": "The bucket name. Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3 (for example, amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Access points - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Object Lambda access points - When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code InvalidAccessPointAliasError is returned. For more information about InvalidAccessPointAliasError, see List of Error Codes. S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User Guide.",
