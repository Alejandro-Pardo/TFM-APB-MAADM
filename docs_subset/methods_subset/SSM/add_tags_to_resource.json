  "description": "Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your automations, documents, managed nodes, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed nodes that helps you track each node's owner and stack level. For example: Most resources can have a maximum of 50 tags. Automations can have a maximum of 5 tags. We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters. For more information about using tags with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, see Tag your Amazon EC2 resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.",

For example, an OpsMetadata object with an ARN of arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:1234567890:opsmetadata/aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager has a ResourceID of either aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager or /aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager.
