Automation (dict) --- Information about the optional inputs that can be specified for an automation execution preview. Parameters (dict) --- Information about parameters that can be specified for the preview operation. (string) --- (list) --- (string) --- TargetParameterName (string) --- The name of the parameter used as the target resource for the rate-controlled execution. Required if you specify targets. Targets (list) --- Information about the resources that would be included in the actual runbook execution, if it were to be run. Both Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together. (dict) --- An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a key-value pair that you specify. Supported formats include the following. Key=tag-key,Values=tag-value-1,tag-value-2 Key=tag:tag-key,Values=tag-value Key=ResourceGroup,Values=resource-group-name Key=ParameterValues,Values=value-1,value-2,value-3 To target all instances in the Amazon Web Services Region: Key=AWS::EC2::Instance,Values=* Key=InstanceIds,Values=* Key=InstanceIds,Values=instance-id-1,instance-id-2,instance-id-3 Key=tag:tag-key,Values=tag-value-1,tag-value-2 Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=resource-group-name Additionally, Maintenance Windows support targeting resource types: Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=resource-type-1,resource-type-2 Key=InstanceIds,Values=instance-id-1,instance-id-2,instance-id-3 Key=tag:tag-key,Values=tag-value-1,tag-value-2 To target all instances in the Amazon Web Services Region: Key=InstanceIds,Values=* For more information about how to send commands that target managed nodes using Key,Value parameters, see Targeting multiple managed nodes in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. Key (string) --- User-defined criteria for sending commands that target managed nodes that meet the criteria. Values (list) --- User-defined criteria that maps to Key. For example, if you specified tag:ServerRole, you could specify value:WebServer to run a command on instances that include EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer. Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50. (string) --- TargetMaps (list) --- A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. (dict) --- (string) --- (list) --- (string) --- TargetLocations (list) --- Information about the Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web Services accounts targeted by the Automation execution preview operation. (dict) --- The combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web Services accounts targeted by the current Automation execution. Accounts (list) --- The Amazon Web Services accounts targeted by the current Automation execution. (string) --- Regions (list) --- The Amazon Web Services Regions targeted by the current Automation execution. (string) --- TargetLocationMaxConcurrency (string) --- The maximum number of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web Services accounts allowed to run the Automation concurrently. TargetLocationMaxErrors (string) --- The maximum number of errors allowed before the system stops queueing additional Automation executions for the currently running Automation. ExecutionRoleName (string) --- The Automation execution role used by the currently running Automation. If not specified, the default value is AWS-SystemsManager-AutomationExecutionRole. TargetLocationAlarmConfiguration (dict) --- The details for the CloudWatch alarm you want to apply to an automation or command. IgnorePollAlarmFailure (boolean) --- When this value is true, your automation or command continues to run in cases where we can't retrieve alarm status information from CloudWatch. In cases where we successfully retrieve an alarm status of OK or INSUFFICIENT_DATA, the automation or command continues to run, regardless of this value. Default is false. The name of the CloudWatch alarm specified in the configuration. (dict) --- A CloudWatch alarm you apply to an automation or command. The name of your CloudWatch alarm. IncludeChildOrganizationUnits (boolean) --- Indicates whether to include child organizational units (OUs) that are children of the targeted OUs. The default is false. ExcludeAccounts (list) --- Amazon Web Services accounts or organizational units to exclude as expanded targets. (string) --- Targets (list) --- A list of key-value mappings to target resources. If you specify values for this data type, you must also specify a value for TargetParameterName. This Targets parameter takes precedence over the StartAutomationExecution:Targets parameter if both are supplied. (string) --- TargetsMaxConcurrency (string) --- The maximum number of targets allowed to run this task in parallel. This TargetsMaxConcurrency takes precedence over the StartAutomationExecution:MaxConcurrency parameter if both are supplied. TargetsMaxErrors (string) --- The maximum number of errors that are allowed before the system stops running the automation on additional targets. This TargetsMaxErrors parameter takes precedence over the StartAutomationExecution:MaxErrors parameter if both are supplied. TargetLocationsURL (string) --- A publicly accessible URL for a file that contains the TargetLocations body. Currently, only files in presigned Amazon S3 buckets are supported.",
