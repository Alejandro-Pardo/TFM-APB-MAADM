      "description": "Defines the basic information about a patch baseline override. OperatingSystem (string) --- The operating system rule used by the patch baseline override. GlobalFilters (dict) --- A set of patch filters, typically used for approval rules. The set of patch filters that make up the group. (dict) --- Defines which patches should be included in a patch baseline. A patch filter consists of a key and a set of values. The filter key is a patch property. For example, the available filter keys for WINDOWS are PATCH_SET, PRODUCT, PRODUCT_FAMILY, CLASSIFICATION, and MSRC_SEVERITY. The filter values define a matching criterion for the patch property indicated by the key. For example, if the filter key is PRODUCT and the filter values are [\"Office 2013\", \"Office 2016\"], then the filter accepts all patches where product name is either 'Office 2013' or 'Office 2016'. The filter values can be exact values for the patch property given as a key, or a wildcard (*), which matches all values. You can view lists of valid values for the patch properties by running the DescribePatchProperties command. For information about which patch properties can be used with each major operating system, see  DescribePatchProperties. The key for the filter. Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of valid keys for each operating system type. The value for the filter key. Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of valid values for each key based on operating system type. (string) --- ApprovalRules (dict) --- A set of rules defining the approval rules for a patch baseline. The rules that make up the rule group. (dict) --- Defines an approval rule for a patch baseline. The patch filter group that defines the criteria for the rule. (string) --- ComplianceLevel (string) --- A compliance severity level for all approved patches in a patch baseline. ApproveAfterDays (integer) --- The number of days after the release date of each patch matched by the rule that the patch is marked as approved in the patch baseline. For example, a value of 7 means that patches are approved seven days after they are released. This parameter is marked as Required: No, but your request must include a value for either ApproveAfterDays or ApproveUntilDate. Not supported for Debian Server or Ubuntu Server. ApproveUntilDate (string) --- The cutoff date for auto approval of released patches. Any patches released on or before this date are installed automatically. Enter dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD. For example, 2024-12-31. This parameter is marked as Required: No, but your request must include a value for either ApproveUntilDate or ApproveAfterDays. EnableNonSecurity (boolean) --- For managed nodes identified by the approval rule filters, enables a patch baseline to apply non-security updates available in the specified repository. The default value is false. Applies to Linux managed nodes only. ApprovedPatches (list) --- A list of explicitly approved patches for the baseline. For information about accepted formats for lists of approved patches and rejected patches, see Package name formats for approved and rejected patch lists in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. (string) --- ApprovedPatchesComplianceLevel (string) --- Defines the compliance level for approved patches. When an approved patch is reported as missing, this value describes the severity of the compliance violation. RejectedPatches (list) --- A list of explicitly rejected patches for the baseline. (string) --- RejectedPatchesAction (string) --- The action for Patch Manager to take on patches included in the RejectedPackages list. A patch can be allowed only if it is a dependency of another package, or blocked entirely along with packages that include it as a dependency. ApprovedPatchesEnableNonSecurity (boolean) --- Indicates whether the list of approved patches includes non-security updates that should be applied to the managed nodes. Sources (list) --- Information about the patches to use to update the managed nodes, including target operating systems and source repositories. (dict) --- Information about the patches to use to update the managed nodes, including target operating systems and source repository. The name specified to identify the patch source. The specific operating system versions a patch repository applies to, such as 'Ubuntu16.04', 'AmazonLinux2016.09', 'RedhatEnterpriseLinux7.2' or 'Suse12.7'. For lists of supported product values, see  PatchFilter. (string) --- The value of the yum repo configuration. For example: [main] name=MyCustomRepository baseurl=https://my-custom-repository enabled=1 AvailableSecurityUpdatesComplianceStatus (string) --- Indicates whether managed nodes for which there are available security-related patches that have not been approved by the baseline are being defined as COMPLIANT or NON_COMPLIANT. This option is specified when the CreatePatchBaseline or UpdatePatchBaseline commands are run. Applies to Windows Server managed nodes only.",
