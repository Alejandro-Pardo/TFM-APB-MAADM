    "description": "A low-level client representing Amazon Location Service Routes V2 With the Amazon Location Routes API you can calculate routes and estimate travel time based on up-to-date road network and live traffic information. Calculate optimal travel routes and estimate travel times using up-to-date road network and traffic data. Key features include: Point-to-point routing with estimated travel time, distance, and turn-by-turn directions Multi-point route optimization to minimize travel time or distance Route matrices for efficient multi-destination planning Isoline calculations to determine reachable areas within specified time or distance thresholds Map-matching to align GPS traces with the road network",
