  "description": "Describes the settings for the Insights event selectors that you configured for your trail or event data store. GetInsightSelectors shows if CloudTrail Insights event logging is enabled on the trail or event data store, and if it is, which Insights types are enabled. If you run GetInsightSelectors on a trail or event data store that does not have Insights events enabled, the operation throws the exception InsightNotEnabledException. Specify either the EventDataStore parameter to get Insights event selectors for an event data store, or the TrailName parameter to the get Insights event selectors for a trail. You cannot specify these parameters together. For more information, see Working with CloudTrail Insights in the CloudTrail User Guide.",
