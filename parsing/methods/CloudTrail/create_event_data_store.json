For more information about how to use advanced event selectors to include Config configuration items in your event data store, see Create an event data store for Config configuration items in the CloudTrail User Guide. For more information about how to use advanced event selectors to include events outside of Amazon Web Services events in your event data store, see Create an integration to log events from outside Amazon Web Services in the CloudTrail User Guide. (dict) --- Advanced event selectors let you create fine-grained selectors for CloudTrail management, data, and network activity events. They help you control costs by logging only those events that are important to you. For more information about configuring advanced event selectors, see the Logging data events, Logging network activity events, and Logging management events topics in the CloudTrail User Guide. You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail. For information about configurable advanced event selector fields, see AdvancedEventSelector in the CloudTrail API Reference. Name (string) --- An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector, such as 'Log data events for only two S3 buckets'. Contains all selector statements in an advanced event selector. (dict) --- A single selector statement in an advanced event selector. A field in a CloudTrail event record on which to filter events to be logged. For event data stores for CloudTrail Insights events, Config configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or events outside of Amazon Web Services, the field is used only for selecting events as filtering is not supported. For more information, see AdvancedFieldSelector in the CloudTrail API Reference.
