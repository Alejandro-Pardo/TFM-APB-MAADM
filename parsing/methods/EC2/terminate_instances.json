  "description": "Shuts down the specified instances. This operation is idempotent; if you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds. If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of a single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated. If you terminate multiple instances across multiple Availability Zones, and one or more of the specified instances are enabled for termination protection, the request fails with the following results: For example, say you have the following instances: If you attempt to terminate all of these instances in the same request, the request reports failure with the following results: Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one hour). By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running. You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop or terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached EBS volumes with the DeleteOnTermination block device mapping parameter set to true are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between stopping and terminating instances, see Amazon EC2 instance state changes in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. For information about troubleshooting, see Troubleshooting terminating your instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.",
