    {
      "name": "LaunchSpecification",
      "type": "dict",
      "required": true,
      "description": "The launch specification. SecurityGroupIds (list) --- The IDs of the security groups. (string) --- SecurityGroups (list) --- Not supported. (string) --- AddressingType (string) --- Deprecated. BlockDeviceMappings (list) --- The block device mapping entries. You can't specify both a snapshot ID and an encryption value. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on creation. If a snapshot is the basis for a volume, it is not blank and its encryption status is used for the volume encryption status. (dict) --- Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch. Ebs (dict) --- Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched. DeleteOnTermination (boolean) --- Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Iops (integer) --- The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3, io1, and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting. The following are the supported values for each volume type: gp3: 3,000 - 16,000 IOPS io1: 100 - 64,000 IOPS io2: 100 - 256,000 IOPS For io2 volumes, you can achieve up to 256,000 IOPS on instances built on the Nitro System. On other instances, you can achieve performance up to 32,000 IOPS. This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. SnapshotId (string) --- The ID of the snapshot. VolumeSize (integer) --- The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size. The following are the supported sizes for each volume type: gp2 and gp3: 1 - 16,384 GiB io1: 4 - 16,384 GiB io2: 4 - 65,536 GiB st1 and sc1: 125 - 16,384 GiB standard: 1 - 1024 GiB VolumeType (string) --- The volume type. For more information, see Amazon EBS volume types in the Amazon EBS User Guide. KmsKeyId (string) --- Identifier (key ID, key alias, key ARN, or alias ARN) of the customer managed KMS key to use for EBS encryption. This parameter is only supported on BlockDeviceMapping objects called by RunInstances, RequestSpotFleet, and RequestSpotInstances. Throughput (integer) --- The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s. This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes. Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000. OutpostArn (string) --- The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored. This parameter is not supported when using CreateImage. Encrypted (boolean) --- Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EBS User Guide. In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume. Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see Supported instance types. This parameter is not returned by  DescribeImageAttribute. For  CreateImage and  RegisterImage, whether you can include this parameter, and the allowed values differ depending on the type of block device mapping you are creating. If you are creating a block device mapping for a new (empty) volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true for an encrypted volume, or false for an unencrypted volume. If you omit this parameter, it defaults to false (unencrypted). If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted or unencrypted snapshot, you must omit this parameter. If you include this parameter, the request will fail, regardless of the value that you specify. If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing unencrypted volume, you can include this parameter, but you must specify false. If you specify true, the request will fail. In this case, we recommend that you omit the parameter. If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true or false. However, if you specify false, the parameter is ignored and the block device mapping is always encrypted. NoDevice (string) --- To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify an empty string. When this property is specified, the device is removed from the block device mapping regardless of the assigned value. DeviceName (string) --- The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh). VirtualName (string) --- The virtual device name ( ephemeral``N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ``ephemeral0 and ephemeral1. The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume. NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect. Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI. EbsOptimized (boolean) --- Indicates whether the instance is optimized for EBS I/O. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal EBS I/O performance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS Optimized instance. Default: false IamInstanceProfile (dict) --- The IAM instance profile. Arn (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance profile. Name (string) --- The name of the instance profile. ImageId (string) --- The ID of the AMI. InstanceType (string) --- The instance type. Only one instance type can be specified. KernelId (string) --- The ID of the kernel. KeyName (string) --- The name of the key pair. Monitoring (dict) --- Indicates whether basic or detailed monitoring is enabled for the instance. Default: Disabled Indicates whether detailed monitoring is enabled. Otherwise, basic monitoring is enabled. NetworkInterfaces (list) --- The network interfaces. If you specify a network interface, you must specify subnet IDs and security group IDs using the network interface. (dict) --- Describes a network interface. AssociatePublicIpAddress (boolean) --- Indicates whether to assign a public IPv4 address to an instance you launch in a VPC. The public IP address can only be assigned to a network interface for eth0, and can only be assigned to a new network interface, not an existing one. You cannot specify more than one network interface in the request. If launching into a default subnet, the default value is true. Amazon Web Services charges for all public IPv4 addresses, including public IPv4 addresses associated with running instances and Elastic IP addresses. For more information, see the Public IPv4 Address tab on the Amazon VPC pricing page. DeleteOnTermination (boolean) --- If set to true, the interface is deleted when the instance is terminated. You can specify true only if creating a new network interface when launching an instance. Description (string) --- The description of the network interface. Applies only if creating a network interface when launching an instance. DeviceIndex (integer) --- The position of the network interface in the attachment order. A primary network interface has a device index of 0. If you specify a network interface when launching an instance, you must specify the device index. Groups (list) --- The IDs of the security groups for the network interface. (string) --- Ipv6AddressCount (integer) --- A number of IPv6 addresses to assign to the network interface. Amazon EC2 chooses the IPv6 addresses from the range of the subnet. You cannot specify this option and the option to assign specific IPv6 addresses in the same request. You can specify this option if you've specified a minimum number of instances to launch. Ipv6Addresses (list) --- The IPv6 addresses to assign to the network interface. You cannot specify this option and the option to assign a number of IPv6 addresses in the same request. You cannot specify this option if you've specified a minimum number of instances to launch. (dict) --- Describes an IPv6 address. Ipv6Address (string) --- The IPv6 address. IsPrimaryIpv6 (boolean) --- Determines if an IPv6 address associated with a network interface is the primary IPv6 address. When you enable an IPv6 GUA address to be a primary IPv6, the first IPv6 GUA will be made the primary IPv6 address until the instance is terminated or the network interface is detached. For more information, see RunInstances. NetworkInterfaceId (string) --- The ID of the network interface. If you are creating a Spot Fleet, omit this parameter because you can't specify a network interface ID in a launch specification. PrivateIpAddress (string) --- The private IPv4 address of the network interface. You cannot specify this option if you're launching more than one instance in a RunInstances request. PrivateIpAddresses (list) --- The private IPv4 addresses to assign to the network interface. Only one private IPv4 address can be designated as primary. (dict) --- Describes a secondary private IPv4 address for a network interface. Primary (boolean) --- Indicates whether the private IPv4 address is the primary private IPv4 address. Only one IPv4 address can be designated as primary. PrivateIpAddress (string) --- The private IPv4 address. SecondaryPrivateIpAddressCount (integer) --- The number of secondary private IPv4 addresses. You can't specify this parameter and also specify a secondary private IP address using the PrivateIpAddress parameter. SubnetId (string) --- The ID of the subnet associated with the network interface. AssociateCarrierIpAddress (boolean) --- Indicates whether to assign a carrier IP address to the network interface. You can only assign a carrier IP address to a network interface that is in a subnet in a Wavelength Zone. For more information about carrier IP addresses, see Carrier IP address in the Amazon Web Services Wavelength Developer Guide. InterfaceType (string) --- The type of network interface. If you specify efa-only, do not assign any IP addresses to the network interface. EFA-only network interfaces do not support IP addresses. Valid values: interface | efa | efa-only NetworkCardIndex (integer) --- The index of the network card. Some instance types support multiple network cards. The primary network interface must be assigned to network card index 0. The default is network card index 0. If you are using RequestSpotInstances to create Spot Instances, omit this parameter because you can't specify the network card index when using this API. To specify the network card index, use RunInstances. Ipv4Prefixes (list) --- The IPv4 delegated prefixes to be assigned to the network interface. You cannot use this option if you use the Ipv4PrefixCount option. (dict) --- Describes the IPv4 prefix option for a network interface. Ipv4Prefix (string) --- The IPv4 prefix. For information, see Assigning prefixes to network interfaces in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Ipv4PrefixCount (integer) --- The number of IPv4 delegated prefixes to be automatically assigned to the network interface. You cannot use this option if you use the Ipv4Prefix option. Ipv6Prefixes (list) --- The IPv6 delegated prefixes to be assigned to the network interface. You cannot use this option if you use the Ipv6PrefixCount option. (dict) --- Describes the IPv6 prefix option for a network interface. Ipv6Prefix (string) --- The IPv6 prefix. Ipv6PrefixCount (integer) --- The number of IPv6 delegated prefixes to be automatically assigned to the network interface. You cannot use this option if you use the Ipv6Prefix option. PrimaryIpv6 (boolean) --- The primary IPv6 address of the network interface. For more information about primary IPv6 addresses, see RunInstances. EnaSrdSpecification (dict) --- Specifies the ENA Express settings for the network interface that's attached to the instance. EnaSrdEnabled (boolean) --- Specifies whether ENA Express is enabled for the network interface when you launch an instance. EnaSrdUdpSpecification (dict) --- Contains ENA Express settings for UDP network traffic for the network interface attached to the instance. EnaSrdUdpEnabled (boolean) --- Indicates whether UDP traffic uses ENA Express for your instance. To ensure that UDP traffic can use ENA Express when you launch an instance, you must also set EnaSrdEnabled in the EnaSrdSpecificationRequest to true. ConnectionTrackingSpecification (dict) --- A security group connection tracking specification that enables you to set the timeout for connection tracking on an Elastic network interface. For more information, see Connection tracking timeouts in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. TcpEstablishedTimeout (integer) --- Timeout (in seconds) for idle TCP connections in an established state. Min: 60 seconds. Max: 432000 seconds (5 days). Default: 432000 seconds. Recommended: Less than 432000 seconds. UdpStreamTimeout (integer) --- Timeout (in seconds) for idle UDP flows classified as streams which have seen more than one request-response transaction. Max: 180 seconds (3 minutes). Default: 180 seconds. UdpTimeout (integer) --- Timeout (in seconds) for idle UDP flows that have seen traffic only in a single direction or a single request-response transaction. Min: 30 seconds.
