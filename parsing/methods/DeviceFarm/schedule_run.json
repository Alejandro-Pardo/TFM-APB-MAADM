Either devicePoolArn or deviceSelectionConfiguration is required in a request. Used to dynamically select a set of devices for a test run. A filter is made up of an attribute, an operator, and one or more values. Attribute The aspect of a device such as platform or model used as the selection criteria in a device filter. Allowed values include: ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device (for example, arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2::device:12345Example). PLATFORM: The device platform. Valid values are ANDROID or IOS. OS_VERSION: The operating system version (for example, 10.3.2). MODEL: The device model (for example, iPad 5th Gen). AVAILABILITY: The current availability of the device. Valid values are AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE. FORM_FACTOR: The device form factor. Valid values are PHONE or TABLET. MANUFACTURER: The device manufacturer (for example, Apple). REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for remote access. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for remote debugging. Because remote debugging is no longer supported, this filter is ignored. INSTANCE_ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance. INSTANCE_LABELS: The label of the device instance. FLEET_TYPE: The fleet type. Valid values are PUBLIC or PRIVATE. Operator The filter operator. The EQUALS operator is available for every attribute except INSTANCE_LABELS. The CONTAINS operator is available for the INSTANCE_LABELS and MODEL attributes. The IN and NOT_IN operators are available for the ARN, OS_VERSION, MODEL, MANUFACTURER, and INSTANCE_ARN attributes. The LESS_THAN, GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS, and GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS operators are also available for the OS_VERSION attribute. Values An array of one or more filter values. Operator Values The IN and NOT_IN operators can take a values array that has more than one element. The other operators require an array with a single element. The PLATFORM attribute can be set to ANDROID or IOS. The AVAILABILITY attribute can be set to AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE. The FORM_FACTOR attribute can be set to PHONE or TABLET. The FLEET_TYPE attribute can be set to PUBLIC or PRIVATE.
