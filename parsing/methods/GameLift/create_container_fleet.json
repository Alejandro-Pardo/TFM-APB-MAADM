  "description": "Creates a managed fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to host your containerized game servers. Use this operation to define how to deploy a container architecture onto each fleet instance and configure fleet settings. You can create a container fleet in any Amazon Web Services Regions that Amazon GameLift supports for multi-location fleets. A container fleet can be deployed to a single location or multiple locations. Container fleets are deployed with Amazon Linux 2023 as the instance operating system. Define the fleet's container architecture using container group definitions. Each fleet can have one of the following container group types: Each container group can include the definition for one or more containers. A container definition specifies a container image that is stored in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) public or private repository. Use this operation to make the following types of requests. Most fleet settings have default values, so you can create a working fleet with a minimal configuration and default values, which you can customize later. If successful, this operation creates a new container fleet resource, places it in PENDING status, and initiates the fleet creation workflow. For fleets with container groups, this workflow starts a fleet deployment and transitions the status to ACTIVE. Fleets without a container group are placed in CREATED status. You can update most of the properties of a fleet, including container group definitions, and deploy the update across all fleet instances. Use a fleet update to deploy a new game server version update across the container fleet.",
