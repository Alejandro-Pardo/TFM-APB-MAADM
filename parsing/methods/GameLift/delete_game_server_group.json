  "description": "Terminates a game server group and permanently deletes the game server group record. You have several options for how these resources are impacted when deleting the game server group. Depending on the type of delete operation selected, this operation might affect these resources: To delete a game server group, identify the game server group to delete and specify the type of delete operation to initiate. Game server groups can only be deleted if they are in ACTIVE or ERROR status. If the delete request is successful, a series of operations are kicked off. The game server group status is changed to DELETE_SCHEDULED, which prevents new game servers from being registered and stops automatic scaling activity. Once all game servers in the game server group are deregistered, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources. If any of the delete operations fail, the game server group is placed in ERROR status. Amazon GameLift FleetIQ emits delete events to Amazon CloudWatch. Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Guide.",
