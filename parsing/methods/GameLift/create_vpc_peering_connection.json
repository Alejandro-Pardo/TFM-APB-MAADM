  "description": "Establishes a VPC peering connection between a virtual private cloud (VPC) in an Amazon Web Services account with the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet. VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other Amazon Web Services resources. You can peer with VPCs in any Amazon Web Services account that you have access to, including the account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different Regions. For more information, see VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets. Before calling this operation to establish the peering connection, you first need to use CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization and identify the VPC you want to peer with. Once the authorization for the specified VPC is issued, you have 24 hours to establish the connection. These two operations handle all tasks necessary to peer the two VPCs, including acceptance, updating routing tables, etc. To establish the connection, call this operation from the Amazon Web Services account that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the fleet you want to be enable a VPC peering connection for; (2) The Amazon Web Services account with the VPC that you want to peer with; and (3) The ID of the VPC you want to peer with. This operation is asynchronous. If successful, a connection request is created. You can use continuous polling to track the request's status using DescribeVpcPeeringConnections , or by monitoring fleet events for success or failure using DescribeFleetEvents . All APIs by task.",
