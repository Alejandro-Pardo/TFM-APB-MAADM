  "description": "Provides a list of utterances that users have sent to the bot. Utterances are aggregated by the text of the utterance. For example, all instances where customers used the phrase 'I want to order pizza' are aggregated into the same line in the response. You can see both detected utterances and missed utterances. A detected utterance is where the bot properly recognized the utterance and activated the associated intent. A missed utterance was not recognized by the bot and didn't activate an intent. Utterances can be aggregated for a bot alias or for a bot version, but not both at the same time. Utterances statistics are not generated under the following conditions:",
