For Glue version 2.0+ jobs, you cannot specify a Maximum capacity. Instead, you should specify a Worker type and the Number of workers. Do not set MaxCapacity if using WorkerType and NumberOfWorkers. The value that can be allocated for MaxCapacity depends on whether you are running a Python shell job, an Apache Spark ETL job, or an Apache Spark streaming ETL job: When you specify a Python shell job ( ``JobCommand.Name``='pythonshell'), you can allocate either 0.0625 or 1 DPU. The default is 0.0625 DPU. When you specify an Apache Spark ETL job ( ``JobCommand.Name``='glueetl') or Apache Spark streaming ETL job ( ``JobCommand.Name``='gluestreaming'), you can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs.

For the G.1X worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPUs, 16 GB of memory) with 94GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for workloads such as data transforms, joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective way to run most jobs. For the G.2X worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPUs, 32 GB of memory) with 138GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. For the G.4X worker type, each worker maps to 4 DPU (16 vCPUs, 64 GB of memory) with 256GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most demanding transforms, aggregations, joins, and queries. This worker type is available only for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), and Europe (Stockholm). For the G.8X worker type, each worker maps to 8 DPU (32 vCPUs, 128 GB of memory) with 512GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. This worker type is available only for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs, in the same Amazon Web Services Regions as supported for the G.4X worker type. For the G.025X worker type, each worker maps to 0.25 DPU (2 vCPUs, 4 GB of memory) with 84GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for low volume streaming jobs. This worker type is only available for Glue version 3.0 or later streaming jobs. For the Z.2X worker type, each worker maps to 2 M-DPU (8vCPUs, 64 GB of memory) with 128 GB disk, and provides up to 8 Ray workers based on the autoscaler.",
