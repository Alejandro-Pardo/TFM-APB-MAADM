  "description": "After you generate a group or policy report using the GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation, you can use the JobId parameter in GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities. This operation retrieves the status of your report job and a list of entities that could have used group or policy permissions to access the specified service. You can also use this operation for user or role reports to retrieve details about those entities. If the operation fails, the GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities operation returns the reason that it failed. By default, the list of associated entities is sorted by date, with the most recent access listed first.",
