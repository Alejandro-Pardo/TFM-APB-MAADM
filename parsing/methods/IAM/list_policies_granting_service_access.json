  "description": "Retrieves a list of policies that the IAM identity (user, group, or role) can use to access each specified service. The list of policies returned by the operation depends on the ARN of the identity that you provide. For each managed policy, this operation returns the ARN and policy name. For each inline policy, it returns the policy name and the entity to which it is attached. Inline policies do not have an ARN. For more information about these policy types, see Managed policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide. Policies that are attached to users and roles as permissions boundaries are not returned. To view which managed policy is currently used to set the permissions boundary for a user or role, use the  GetUser or  GetRole operations.",
