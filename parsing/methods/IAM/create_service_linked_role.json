This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your Amazon Web Services resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to control the role helps improve service stability and proper cleanup when a service and its role are no longer needed. For more information, see Using service-linked roles in the IAM User Guide. To attach a policy to this service-linked role, you must make the request using the Amazon Web Services service that depends on this role.",
