      "description": "A list of change request objects that are run in order. A change request object consists of changeType , s3Path, and dbPath. A changeType can have the following values: PUT --- Adds or updates files in a database. DELETE --- Deletes files in a database. All the change requests require a mandatory dbPath attribute that defines the path within the database directory. All database paths must start with a leading / and end with a trailing /. The s3Path attribute defines the s3 source file path and is required for a PUT change type. The s3path must end with a trailing / if it is a directory and must end without a trailing / if it is a file. Here are few examples of how you can use the change request object: This request adds a single sym file at database root location. { \"changeType\": \"PUT\", \"s3Path\":\"s3://bucket/db/sym\", \"dbPath\":\"/\"} This request adds files in the given s3Path under the 2020.01.02 partition of the database. { \"changeType\": \"PUT\", \"s3Path\":\"s3://bucket/db/2020.01.02/\", \"dbPath\":\"/2020.01.02/\"} This request adds files in the given s3Path under the taq table partition of the database. [ { \"changeType\": \"PUT\", \"s3Path\":\"s3://bucket/db/2020.01.02/taq/\", \"dbPath\":\"/2020.01.02/taq/\"}] This request deletes the 2020.01.02 partition of the database. [{ \"changeType\": \"DELETE\", \"dbPath\": \"/2020.01.02/\"} ] The DELETE request allows you to delete the existing files under the 2020.01.02 partition of the database, and the PUT request adds a new taq table under it. [ {\"changeType\": \"DELETE\", \"dbPath\":\"/2020.01.02/\"}, {\"changeType\": \"PUT\", \"s3Path\":\"s3://bucket/db/2020.01.02/taq/\", \"dbPath\":\"/2020.01.02/taq/\"}] (dict) --- A list of change request objects.
