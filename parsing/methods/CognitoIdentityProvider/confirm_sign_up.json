  "description": "Confirms the account of a new user. This public API operation submits a code that Amazon Cognito sent to your user when they signed up in your user pool. After your user enters their code, they confirm ownership of the email address or phone number that they provided, and their user account becomes active. Depending on your user pool configuration, your users will receive their confirmation code in an email or SMS message. Local users who signed up in your user pool are the only type of user who can confirm sign-up with a code. Users who federate through an external identity provider (IdP) have already been confirmed by their IdP.",
