You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. The AdminResetUserPassword API operation invokes the function that is assigned to the custom message trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminResetUserPassword request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.
