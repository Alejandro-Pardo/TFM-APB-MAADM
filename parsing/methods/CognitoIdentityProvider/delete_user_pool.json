  "description": "Deletes a user pool. After you delete a user pool, users can no longer sign in to any associated applications. When you delete a user pool, it's no longer visible or operational in your Amazon Web Services account. Amazon Cognito retains deleted user pools in an inactive state for 14 days, then begins a cleanup process that fully removes them from Amazon Web Services systems. In case of accidental deletion, contact Amazon Web ServicesSupport within 14 days for restoration assistance. Amazon Cognito begins full deletion of all resources from deleted user pools after 14 days. In the case of large user pools, the cleanup process might take significant additional time before all user data is permanently deleted.",
