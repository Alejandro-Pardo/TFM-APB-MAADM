The values for authentication flow options include the following. ALLOW_USER_AUTH: Enable selection-based sign-in with USER_AUTH. This setting covers username-password, secure remote password (SRP), passwordless, and passkey authentication. This authentiation flow can do username-password and SRP authentication without other ExplicitAuthFlows permitting them. For example users can complete an SRP challenge through USER_AUTH without the flow USER_SRP_AUTH being active for the app client. This flow doesn't include CUSTOM_AUTH. To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the Essentials tier or higher. ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH: Enable admin based user password authentication flow ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH. This setting replaces the ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH setting. With this authentication flow, your app passes a user name and password to Amazon Cognito in the request, instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to securely transmit the password. ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH: Enable Lambda trigger based authentication. ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH: Enable user password-based authentication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords. ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH: Enable SRP-based authentication. ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH: Enable authflow to refresh tokens. In some environments, you will see the values ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH, CUSTOM_AUTH_FLOW_ONLY, or USER_PASSWORD_AUTH.
