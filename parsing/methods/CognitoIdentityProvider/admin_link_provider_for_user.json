  "description": "Links an existing user account in a user pool, or DestinationUser, to an identity from an external IdP, or SourceUser, based on a specified attribute name and value from the external IdP. This operation connects a local user profile with a user identity who hasn't yet signed in from their third-party IdP. When the user signs in with their IdP, they get access-control configuration from the local user profile. Linked local users can also sign in with SDK-based API operations like InitiateAuth after they sign in at least once through their IdP. For more information, see Linking federated users.",

This user can be a local (Username + Password) Amazon Cognito user pools user or a federated user (for example, a SAML or Facebook user).

For a native username + password user, the ProviderAttributeValue for the DestinationUser should be the username in the user pool. For a federated user, it should be the provider-specific user_id. The ProviderAttributeName of the DestinationUser is ignored. The ProviderName should be set to Cognito for users in Cognito user pools.

If the SourceUser is using a federated social IdP, such as Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon, you must set the ProviderAttributeName to Cognito_Subject. For social IdPs, the ProviderName will be Facebook, Google, or LoginWithAmazon, and Amazon Cognito will automatically parse the Facebook, Google, and Login with Amazon tokens for id, sub, and user_id, respectively. The ProviderAttributeValue for the user must be the same value as the id, sub, or user_id value found in the social IdP token. For OIDC, the ProviderAttributeName can be any mapped value from a claim in the ID token, or that your app retrieves from the userInfo endpoint. For SAML, the ProviderAttributeName can be any mapped value from a claim in the SAML assertion. The following additional considerations apply to SourceUser for OIDC and SAML providers. You must map the claim to a user pool attribute in your IdP configuration, and set the user pool attribute name as the value of ProviderAttributeName in your AdminLinkProviderForUser request. For example, email. When you set ProviderAttributeName to Cognito_Subject, Amazon Cognito will automatically parse the default unique identifier found in the subject from the IdP token.
