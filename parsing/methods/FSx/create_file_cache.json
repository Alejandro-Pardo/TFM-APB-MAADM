The DRAs link the cache to either an Amazon S3 data repository or a Network File System (NFS) data repository that supports the NFSv3 protocol. The DRA configurations must meet the following requirements: All configurations on the list must be of the same data repository type, either all S3 or all NFS. A cache can't link to different data repository types at the same time. An NFS DRA must link to an NFS file system that supports the NFSv3 protocol. DRA automatic import and automatic export is not supported. (dict) --- The configuration for a data repository association (DRA) to be created during the Amazon File Cache resource creation. The DRA links the cache to either an Amazon S3 bucket or prefix, or a Network File System (NFS) data repository that supports the NFSv3 protocol. The DRA does not support automatic import or automatic export. A path on the cache that points to a high-level directory (such as /ns1/) or subdirectory (such as /ns1/subdir/) that will be mapped 1-1 with DataRepositoryPath. The leading forward slash in the name is required. Two data repository associations cannot have overlapping cache paths. For example, if a data repository is associated with cache path /ns1/, then you cannot link another data repository with cache path /ns1/ns2. This path specifies where in your cache files will be exported from. This cache directory can be linked to only one data repository, and no data repository other can be linked to the directory. The path to the S3 or NFS data repository that links to the cache. You must provide one of the following paths: The path can be an NFS data repository that links to the cache. The path can be in one of two formats: If you are not using the DataRepositorySubdirectories parameter, the path is to an NFS Export directory (or one of its subdirectories) in the format nfs://nfs-domain-name/exportpath. You can therefore link a single NFS Export to a single data repository association. If you are using the DataRepositorySubdirectories parameter, the path is the domain name of the NFS file system in the format nfs://filer-domain-name, which indicates the root of the subdirectories specified with the DataRepositorySubdirectories parameter. The path can be an S3 bucket or prefix in the format s3://bucket-name/prefix/ (where prefix is optional). DataRepositorySubdirectories (list) --- A list of NFS Exports that will be linked with this data repository association. The Export paths are in the format /exportpath1. To use this parameter, you must configure DataRepositoryPath as the domain name of the NFS file system. The NFS file system domain name in effect is the root of the subdirectories. Note that DataRepositorySubdirectories is not supported for S3 data repositories. (string) --- NFS (dict) --- The configuration for a data repository association that links an Amazon File Cache resource to an NFS data repository. The version of the NFS (Network File System) protocol of the NFS data repository. The only supported value is NFS3, which indicates that the data repository must support the NFSv3 protocol. DnsIps (list) --- A list of up to 2 IP addresses of DNS servers used to resolve the NFS file system domain name.
