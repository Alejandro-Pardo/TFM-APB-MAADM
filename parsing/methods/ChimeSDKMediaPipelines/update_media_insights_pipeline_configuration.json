For more information, see Partitioning speakers (diarization) in the Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide. PartialResultsStability (string) --- The level of stability to use when you enable partial results stabilization ( EnablePartialResultsStabilization). If you set both, your request returns a BadRequestException. PiiEntityTypes (string) --- The types of personally identifiable information (PII) to redact from a transcript. If you leave this parameter empty, the default behavior is equivalent to ALL. LanguageModelName (string) --- The name of the custom language model that you want to use when processing your transcription. The language of the specified language model must match the language code you specify in your transcription request. There are no errors or warnings associated with a language mismatch.
