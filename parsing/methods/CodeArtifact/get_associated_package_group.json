  "description": "Returns the most closely associated package group to the specified package. This API does not require that the package exist in any repository in the domain. As such, GetAssociatedPackageGroup can be used to see which package group's origin configuration applies to a package before that package is in a repository. This can be helpful to check if public packages are blocked without ingesting them. For information package group association and matching, see Package group definition syntax and matching behavior in the CodeArtifact User Guide.",
