  "description": "Returns a unique symmetric data key for use outside of KMS. This operation returns a data key that is encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key that you specify. The bytes in the key are random; they are not related to the caller or to the KMS key. GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext is identical to the  GenerateDataKey operation except that it does not return a plaintext copy of the data key. This operation is useful for systems that need to encrypt data at some point, but not immediately. When you need to encrypt the data, you call the  Decrypt operation on the encrypted copy of the key. It's also useful in distributed systems with different levels of trust. For example, you might store encrypted data in containers. One component of your system creates new containers and stores an encrypted data key with each container. Then, a different component puts the data into the containers. That component first decrypts the data key, uses the plaintext data key to encrypt data, puts the encrypted data into the container, and then destroys the plaintext data key. In this system, the component that creates the containers never sees the plaintext data key. To request an asymmetric data key pair, use the  GenerateDataKeyPair or  GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operations. To generate a data key, you must specify the symmetric encryption KMS key that is used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key or a key in a custom key store to generate a data key. To get the type of your KMS key, use the  DescribeKey operation. You must also specify the length of the data key. Use either the KeySpec or NumberOfBytes parameters (but not both). For 128-bit and 256-bit data keys, use the KeySpec parameter. To generate an SM4 data key (China Regions only), specify a KeySpec value of AES_128 or NumberOfBytes value of 16. The symmetric encryption key used in China Regions to encrypt your data key is an SM4 encryption key. If the operation succeeds, you will find the encrypted copy of the data key in the CiphertextBlob field. You can use an optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption operation. If you specify an EncryptionContext, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For more information, see Encryption Context in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter. Required permissions: kms:GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext (key policy) Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",
