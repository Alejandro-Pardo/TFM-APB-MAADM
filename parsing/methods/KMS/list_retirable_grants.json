  "description": "Returns information about all grants in the Amazon Web Services account and Region that have the specified retiring principal. You can specify any principal in your Amazon Web Services account. The grants that are returned include grants for KMS keys in your Amazon Web Services account and other Amazon Web Services accounts. You might use this operation to determine which grants you may retire. To retire a grant, use the  RetireGrant operation. For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see Grants in KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide . For examples of working with grants in several programming languages, see Programming grants. Cross-account use: You must specify a principal in your Amazon Web Services account. This operation returns a list of grants where the retiring principal specified in the ListRetirableGrants request is the same retiring principal on the grant. This can include grants on KMS keys owned by other Amazon Web Services accounts, but you do not need kms:ListRetirableGrants permission (or any other additional permission) in any Amazon Web Services account other than your own. Required permissions: kms:ListRetirableGrants (IAM policy) in your Amazon Web Services account. Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",
