  "description": "Deletes the specified alias. Because an alias is not a property of a KMS key, you can delete and change the aliases of a KMS key without affecting the KMS key. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the  DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all KMS keys, use the  ListAliases operation. Each KMS key can have multiple aliases. To change the alias of a KMS key, use  DeleteAlias to delete the current alias and  CreateAlias to create a new alias. To associate an existing alias with a different KMS key, call  UpdateAlias. Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different Amazon Web Services account. For details, see Controlling access to aliases in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",
