  "description": "Decrypts ciphertext and then reencrypts it entirely within KMS. You can use this operation to change the KMS key under which data is encrypted, such as when you manually rotate a KMS key or change the KMS key that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under the same KMS key, such as to change the encryption context of a ciphertext. The ReEncrypt operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using a KMS key in an KMS operation, such as  Encrypt or  GenerateDataKey. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an asymmetric KMS key outside of KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side encryption. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS. When you use the ReEncrypt operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation. The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Cross-account use: Yes. The source KMS key and destination KMS key can be in different Amazon Web Services accounts. Either or both KMS keys can be in a different account than the caller. To specify a KMS key in a different account, you must use its key ARN or alias ARN. Required permissions: To permit reencryption from or to a KMS key, include the \"kms:ReEncrypt*\" permission in your key policy. This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you use the console to create a KMS key. But you must include it manually when you create a KMS key programmatically or when you use the  PutKeyPolicy operation to set a key policy. Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",
