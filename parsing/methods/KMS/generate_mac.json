  "description": "Generates a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) for a message using an HMAC KMS key and a MAC algorithm that the key supports. HMAC KMS keys and the HMAC algorithms that KMS uses conform to industry standards defined in RFC 2104. You can use value that GenerateMac returns in the  VerifyMac operation to demonstrate that the original message has not changed. Also, because a secret key is used to create the hash, you can verify that the party that generated the hash has the required secret key. You can also use the raw result to implement HMAC-based algorithms such as key derivation functions. This operation is part of KMS support for HMAC KMS keys. For details, see HMAC keys in KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide . The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter. Required permissions: kms:GenerateMac (key policy) Related operations:  VerifyMac. Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",
