  "description": "Initiates a flow to start a new task contact. For more information about task contacts, see Concepts: Tasks in Amazon Connect in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. When using PreviousContactId and RelatedContactId input parameters, note the following: In addition, when calling StartTaskContact include only one of these parameters: ContactFlowID, QuickConnectID, or TaskTemplateID. Only one parameter is required as long as the task template has a flow configured to run it. If more than one parameter is specified, or only the TaskTemplateID is specified but it does not have a flow configured, the request returns an error because Amazon Connect cannot identify the unique flow to run when the task is created. A ServiceQuotaExceededException occurs when the number of open tasks exceeds the active tasks quota or there are already 12 tasks referencing the same PreviousContactId. For more information about service quotas for task contacts, see Amazon Connect service quotas in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.",
