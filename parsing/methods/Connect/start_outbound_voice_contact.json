  "description": "Places an outbound call to a contact, and then initiates the flow. It performs the actions in the flow that's specified (in ContactFlowId). Agents do not initiate the outbound API, which means that they do not dial the contact. If the flow places an outbound call to a contact, and then puts the contact in queue, the call is then routed to the agent, like any other inbound case. There is a 60-second dialing timeout for this operation. If the call is not connected after 60 seconds, it fails.",
