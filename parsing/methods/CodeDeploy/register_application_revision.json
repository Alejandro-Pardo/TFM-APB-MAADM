GitHub: An application revision stored in GitHub (EC2/On-premises deployments only). String: A YAML-formatted or JSON-formatted string (Lambda deployments only). AppSpecContent: An AppSpecContent object that contains the contents of an AppSpec file for an Lambda or Amazon ECS deployment. The content is formatted as JSON or YAML stored as a RawString. s3Location (dict) --- Information about the location of a revision stored in Amazon S3. bucket (string) --- The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where the application revision is stored. key (string) --- The name of the Amazon S3 object that represents the bundled artifacts for the application revision. bundleType (string) --- The file type of the application revision. Must be one of the following: tar: A tar archive file. tgz: A compressed tar archive file. zip: A zip archive file. YAML: A YAML-formatted file. JSON: A JSON-formatted file. version (string) --- A specific version of the Amazon S3 object that represents the bundled artifacts for the application revision. If the version is not specified, the system uses the most recent version by default. eTag (string) --- The ETag of the Amazon S3 object that represents the bundled artifacts for the application revision.

Specified as account/repository. commitId (string) --- The SHA1 commit ID of the GitHub commit that represents the bundled artifacts for the application revision. string (dict) --- Information about the location of an Lambda deployment revision stored as a RawString. content (string) --- The YAML-formatted or JSON-formatted revision string. It includes information about which Lambda function to update and optional Lambda functions that validate deployment lifecycle events. sha256 (string) --- The SHA256 hash value of the revision content. appSpecContent (dict) --- The content of an AppSpec file for an Lambda or Amazon ECS deployment. The content is formatted as JSON or YAML and stored as a RawString. For an Lambda deployment, the content includes a Lambda function name, the alias for its original version, and the alias for its replacement version. The deployment shifts traffic from the original version of the Lambda function to the replacement version. For an Amazon ECS deployment, the content includes the task name, information about the load balancer that serves traffic to the container, and more. For both types of deployments, the content can specify Lambda functions that run at specified hooks, such as BeforeInstall, during a deployment. sha256 (string) --- The SHA256 hash value of the revision content.",
