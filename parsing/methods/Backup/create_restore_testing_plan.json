      "description": "A restore testing plan must contain a unique RestoreTestingPlanName string you create and must contain a ScheduleExpression cron. You may optionally include a StartWindowHours integer and a CreatorRequestId string. The RestoreTestingPlanName is a unique string that is the name of the restore testing plan. This cannot be changed after creation, and it must consist of only alphanumeric characters and underscores. RecoveryPointSelection has five parameters (three required and two optional). The values you specify determine which recovery point is included in the restore test. You must indicate with Algorithm if you want the latest recovery point within your SelectionWindowDays or if you want a random recovery point, and you must indicate through IncludeVaults from which vaults the recovery points can be chosen. Algorithm (required) Valid values: ' LATEST_WITHIN_WINDOW' or ' RANDOM_WITHIN_WINDOW'. Recovery point types (required) Valid values: ' SNAPSHOT' and/or ' CONTINUOUS'. Include SNAPSHOT to restore only snapshot recovery points; include CONTINUOUS to restore continuous recovery points (point in time restore / PITR); use both to restore either a snapshot or a continuous recovery point. The recovery point will be determined by the value for Algorithm. IncludeVaults (required). You must include one or more backup vaults. Use the wildcard ['*'] or specific ARNs. SelectionWindowDays (optional) Value must be an integer (in days) from 1 to 365. If not included, the value defaults to 30. ExcludeVaults (optional). You can choose to input one or more specific backup vault ARNs to exclude those vaults' contents from restore eligibility. Or, you can include a list of selectors. If this parameter and its value are not included, it defaults to empty list. Algorithm (string) --- Acceptable values include 'LATEST_WITHIN_WINDOW' or 'RANDOM_WITHIN_WINDOW' ExcludeVaults (list) --- Accepted values include specific ARNs or list of selectors. Defaults to empty list if not listed.

(string) --- SelectionWindowDays (integer) --- Accepted values are integers from 1 to 365. A CRON expression in specified timezone when a restore testing plan is executed. ScheduleExpressionTimezone (string) --- Optional. This is the timezone in which the schedule expression is set. By default, ScheduleExpressions are in UTC. You can modify this to a specified timezone. StartWindowHours (integer) --- Defaults to 24 hours. A value in hours after a restore test is scheduled before a job will be canceled if it doesn't start successfully. This value is optional. If this value is included, this parameter has a maximum value of 168 hours (one week).",
