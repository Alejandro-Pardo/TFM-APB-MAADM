  "description": "Deletes a group so that all users that belong to the group can no longer access documents only available to that group. For example, after deleting the group 'Summer Interns', all interns who belonged to that group no longer see intern-only documents in their search results. If you want to delete or replace users or sub groups of a group, you need to use the PutPrincipalMapping operation. For example, if a user in the group 'Engineering' leaves the engineering team and another user takes their place, you provide an updated list of users or sub groups that belong to the 'Engineering' group when calling PutPrincipalMapping. You can update your internal list of users or sub groups and input this list when calling PutPrincipalMapping. DeletePrincipalMapping is currently not supported in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US-West) region.",

You can delete a group from accessing documents in a certain data source.

You want to delete 'Research' and 'Engineering' groups from Salesforce, so that these groups cannot access customer-related documents stored in Salesforce.

The highest number ID, which is the ordering ID, is the latest action you want to process and apply on top of other actions with lower number IDs. This prevents previous actions with lower number IDs from possibly overriding the latest action. The ordering ID can be the Unix time of the last update you made to a group members list. You would then provide this list when calling PutPrincipalMapping. This ensures your DELETE action for that updated group with the latest members list doesn't get overwritten by earlier DELETE actions for the same group which are yet to be processed. The default ordering ID is the current Unix time in milliseconds that the action was received by Amazon Kendra.",
