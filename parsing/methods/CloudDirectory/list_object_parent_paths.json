  "description": "Retrieves all available parent paths for any object type such as node, leaf node, policy node, and index node objects. For more information about objects, see Directory Structure. Use this API to evaluate all parents for an object. The call returns all objects from the root of the directory up to the requested object. The API returns the number of paths based on user-defined MaxResults, in case there are multiple paths to the parent. The order of the paths and nodes returned is consistent among multiple API calls unless the objects are deleted or moved. Paths not leading to the directory root are ignored from the target object.",

For more information about paths, see Access Objects. You can identify an object in one of the following ways: $ObjectIdentifier - An object identifier is an opaque string provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the system will provide you with the identifier of the created object. An object's identifier is immutable and no two objects will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an object with ObjectIdentifier, the ObjectIdentifier must be wrapped in double quotes. /some/path - Identifies the object based on path #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call.",
