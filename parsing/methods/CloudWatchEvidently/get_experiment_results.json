  "description": "Retrieves the results of a running or completed experiment. No results are available until there have been 100 events for each variation and at least 10 minutes have passed since the start of the experiment. To increase the statistical power, Evidently performs an additional offline p-value analysis at the end of the experiment. Offline p-value analysis can detect statistical significance in some cases where the anytime p-values used during the experiment do not find statistical significance. Experiment results are available up to 63 days after the start of the experiment. They are not available after that because of CloudWatch data retention policies.",

A p-value is used in hypothesis testing to measure how often you are willing to make a mistake in rejecting the null hypothesis. A general practice is to reject the null hypothesis and declare that the results are statistically significant when the p-value is less than 0.05. ConfidenceInterval specifies a confidence interval for the results. The confidence interval represents the range of values for the chosen metric that is likely to contain the true difference between the baseStat of a variation and the baseline. Evidently returns the 95% confidence interval. TreatmentEffect is the difference in the statistic specified by the baseStat parameter between each variation and the default variation. BaseStat returns the statistical values collected for the metric for each variation. The statistic uses the same statistic specified in the baseStat parameter. Therefore, if baseStat is mean, this returns the mean of the values collected for each variation. (string) ---",
