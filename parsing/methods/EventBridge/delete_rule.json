  "description": "Deletes the specified rule. Before you can delete the rule, you must remove all targets, using RemoveTargets. When you delete a rule, incoming events might continue to match to the deleted rule. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect. If you call delete rule multiple times for the same rule, all calls will succeed. When you call delete rule for a non-existent custom eventbus, ResourceNotFoundException is returned. Managed rules are rules created and managed by another Amazon Web Services service on your behalf. These rules are created by those other Amazon Web Services services to support functionality in those services. You can delete these rules using the Force option, but you should do so only if you are sure the other service is not still using that rule.",
