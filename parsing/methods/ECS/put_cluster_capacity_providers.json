  "description": "Modifies the available capacity providers and the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster. You must specify both the available capacity providers and a default capacity provider strategy for the cluster. If the specified cluster has existing capacity providers associated with it, you must specify all existing capacity providers in addition to any new ones you want to add. Any existing capacity providers that are associated with a cluster that are omitted from a PutClusterCapacityProviders API call will be disassociated with the cluster. You can only disassociate an existing capacity provider from a cluster if it's not being used by any existing tasks. When creating a service or running a task on a cluster, if no capacity provider or launch type is specified, then the cluster's default capacity provider strategy is used. We recommend that you define a default capacity provider strategy for your cluster. However, you must specify an empty array ( []) to bypass defining a default strategy.",

      "description": "The capacity provider strategy to use by default for the cluster. When creating a service or running a task on a cluster, if no capacity provider or launch type is specified then the default capacity provider strategy for the cluster is used. A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers along with the base and weight to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used. If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation. To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used. (dict) --- The details of a capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider strategy can be set when using the RunTask <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RunTask.html>`__or `CreateCluster APIs or as the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster with the CreateCluster API. Only capacity providers that are already associated with a cluster and have an ACTIVE or UPDATING status can be used in a capacity provider strategy. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the CreateClusterCapacityProvider API operation. The Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy. With FARGATE_SPOT, you can run interruption tolerant tasks at a rate that's discounted compared to the FARGATE price. FARGATE_SPOT runs tasks on spare compute capacity. When Amazon Web Services needs the capacity back, your tasks are interrupted with a two-minute warning. FARGATE_SPOT supports Linux tasks with the X86_64 architecture on platform version 1.3.0 or later. FARGATE_SPOT supports Linux tasks with the ARM64 architecture on platform version 1.4.0 or later. A capacity provider strategy can contain a maximum of 20 capacity providers. The short name of the capacity provider. weight (integer) --- The weight value designates the relative percentage of the total number of tasks launched that should use the specified capacity provider. The weight value is taken into consideration after the base value, if defined, is satisfied. If no weight value is specified, the default value of 0 is used. When multiple capacity providers are specified within a capacity provider strategy, at least one of the capacity providers must have a weight value greater than zero and any capacity providers with a weight of 0 can't be used to place tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strategy that all have a weight of 0, any RunTask or CreateService actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail. An example scenario for using weights is defining a strategy that contains two capacity providers and both have a weight of 1, then when the base is satisfied, the tasks will be split evenly across the two capacity providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight of 1 for capacityProviderA and a weight of 4 for capacityProviderB, then for every one task that's run using capacityProviderA, four tasks would use capacityProviderB. base (integer) --- The base value designates how many tasks, at a minimum, to run on the specified capacity provider.
