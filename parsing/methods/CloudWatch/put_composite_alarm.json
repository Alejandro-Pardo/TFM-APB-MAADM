  "description": "Creates or updates a composite alarm. When you create a composite alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule are met. The alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can include metric alarms and other composite alarms. The rule expression of a composite alarm can include as many as 100 underlying alarms. Any single alarm can be included in the rule expressions of as many as 150 composite alarms. Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM state. Composite alarms can take the following actions: When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to INSUFFICIENT_DATA. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed. For a composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the only time that the alarm can be in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm. To use this operation, you must be signed on with the cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm permission that is scoped to *. You can't create a composite alarms if your cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm permission has a narrower scope. If you are an IAM user, you must have iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole to create a composite alarm that has Systems Manager OpsItem actions.",

      "description": "An expression that specifies which other alarms are to be evaluated to determine this composite alarm's state. For each alarm that you reference, you designate a function that specifies whether that alarm needs to be in ALARM state, OK state, or INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. You can use operators (AND, OR and NOT) to combine multiple functions in a single expression. You can use parenthesis to logically group the functions in your expression. You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms that are to be evaluated. Functions can include the following: ALARM(\"alarm-name or alarm-ARN\") is TRUE if the named alarm is in ALARM state. OK(\"alarm-name or alarm-ARN\") is TRUE if the named alarm is in OK state. INSUFFICIENT_DATA(\"alarm-name or alarm-ARN\") is TRUE if the named alarm is in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. TRUE always evaluates to TRUE. FALSE always evaluates to FALSE. TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex AlarmRule structure, and for testing your alarm actions. Alarm names specified in AlarmRule can be surrounded with double-quotes ('), but do not have to be. The following are some examples of AlarmRule: ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh) specifies that the composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if both CPUUtilizationTooHigh and DiskReadOpsTooHigh alarms are in ALARM state. ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND NOT ALARM(DeploymentInProgress) specifies that the alarm goes to ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh is in ALARM state and DeploymentInProgress is not in ALARM state. This example reduces alarm noise during a known deployment window. (ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) OR ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)) AND OK(NetworkOutTooHigh) goes into ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh OR DiskReadOpsTooHigh is in ALARM state, and if NetworkOutTooHigh is in OK state. This provides another example of using a composite alarm to prevent noise. This rule ensures that you are not notified with an alarm action on high CPU or disk usage if a known network problem is also occurring. The AlarmRule can specify as many as 100 'children' alarms. The AlarmRule expression can have as many as 500 elements. Elements are child alarms, TRUE or FALSE statements, and parentheses.",
