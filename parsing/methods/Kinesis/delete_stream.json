  "description": "Deletes a Kinesis data stream and all its shards and data. You must shut down any applications that are operating on the stream before you delete the stream. If an application attempts to operate on a deleted stream, it receives the exception ResourceNotFoundException. If the stream is in the ACTIVE state, you can delete it. After a DeleteStream request, the specified stream is in the DELETING state until Kinesis Data Streams completes the deletion. Note: Kinesis Data Streams might continue to accept data read and write operations, such as  PutRecord,  PutRecords, and  GetRecords, on a stream in the DELETING state until the stream deletion is complete. When you delete a stream, any shards in that stream are also deleted, and any tags are dissociated from the stream. You can use the  DescribeStreamSummary operation to check the state of the stream, which is returned in StreamStatus.",
