With none, the specified string is treated as an exact prefix. With low, suggestions must differ from the specified string by no more than one character. With high, suggestions can differ by up to two characters. The default is none. SortExpression (string) --- An expression that computes a score for each suggestion to control how they are sorted. The scores are rounded to the nearest integer, with a floor of 0 and a ceiling of 2^31-1. A document's relevance score is not computed for suggestions, so sort expressions cannot reference the _score value.
