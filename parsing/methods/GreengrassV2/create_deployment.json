  "description": "Creates a continuous deployment for a target, which is a Greengrass core device or group of core devices. When you add a new core device to a group of core devices that has a deployment, IoT Greengrass deploys that group's deployment to the new device. You can define one deployment for each target. When you create a new deployment for a target that has an existing deployment, you replace the previous deployment. IoT Greengrass applies the new deployment to the target devices. Every deployment has a revision number that indicates how many deployment revisions you define for a target. Use this operation to create a new revision of an existing deployment.

(string) --- (dict) --- Contains information about a component to deploy. The version of the component. configurationUpdate (dict) --- The configuration updates to deploy for the component. You can define reset updates and merge updates. A reset updates the keys that you specify to the default configuration for the component. A merge updates the core device's component configuration with the keys and values that you specify. The IoT Greengrass Core software applies reset updates before it applies merge updates. For more information, see Update component configurations in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide. merge (string) --- A serialized JSON string that contains the configuration object to merge to target devices. The core device merges this configuration with the component's existing configuration. If this is the first time a component deploys on a device, the core device merges this configuration with the component's default configuration. This means that the core device keeps it's existing configuration for keys and values that you don't specify in this object. For more information, see Merge configuration updates in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide. reset (list) --- The list of configuration nodes to reset to default values on target devices. Use JSON pointers to specify each node to reset. JSON pointers start with a forward slash ( /) and use forward slashes to separate the key for each level in the object. For more information, see the JSON pointer specification and Reset configuration updates in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide. (string) --- runWith (dict) --- The system user and group that the IoT Greengrass Core software uses to run component processes on the core device. If you omit this parameter, the IoT Greengrass Core software uses the system user and group that you configure for the core device. For more information, see Configure the user and group that run components in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide. posixUser (string) --- The POSIX system user and, optionally, group to use to run this component on Linux core devices. The user, and group if specified, must exist on each Linux core device. Specify the user and group separated by a colon ( :) in the following format: user:group. The group is optional. If you don't specify a group, the IoT Greengrass Core software uses the primary user for the group. If you omit this parameter, the IoT Greengrass Core software uses the default system user and group that you configure on the Greengrass nucleus component. For more information, see Configure the user and group that run components. systemResourceLimits (dict) --- The system resource limits to apply to this component's process on the core device. IoT Greengrass currently supports this feature on only Linux core devices. If you omit this parameter, the IoT Greengrass Core software uses the default system resource limits that you configure on the Greengrass nucleus component. For more information, see Configure system resource limits for components. memory (integer) --- The maximum amount of RAM, expressed in kilobytes, that a component's processes can use on the core device. cpus (float) --- The maximum amount of CPU time that a component's processes can use on the core device. A core device's total CPU time is equivalent to the device's number of CPU cores. For example, on a core device with 4 CPU cores, you can set this value to 2 to limit the component's processes to 50 percent usage of each CPU core. On a device with 1 CPU core, you can set this value to 0.25 to limit the component's processes to 25 percent usage of the CPU. If you set this value to a number greater than the number of CPU cores, the IoT Greengrass Core software doesn't limit the component's CPU usage. windowsUser (string) --- The Windows user to use to run this component on Windows core devices. The user must exist on each Windows core device, and its name and password must be in the LocalSystem account's Credentials Manager instance.
