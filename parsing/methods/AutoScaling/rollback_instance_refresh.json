  "description": "Cancels an instance refresh that is in progress and rolls back any changes that it made. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling replaces any instances that were replaced during the instance refresh. This restores your Auto Scaling group to the configuration that it was using before the start of the instance refresh. This operation is part of the instance refresh feature in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, which helps you update instances in your Auto Scaling group after you make configuration changes. A rollback is not supported in the following situations: When you receive a successful response from this operation, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling immediately begins replacing instances. You can check the status of this operation through the DescribeInstanceRefreshes API operation.",
