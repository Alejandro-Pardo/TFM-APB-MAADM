  "description": "Tests a registered extension to make sure it meets all necessary requirements for being published in the CloudFormation registry. For more information, see Testing your public extension before publishing in the CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide. If you don't specify a version, CloudFormation uses the default version of the extension in your account and Region for testing. To perform testing, CloudFormation assumes the execution role specified when the type was registered. For more information, see RegisterType. Once you've initiated testing on an extension using TestType, you can pass the returned TypeVersionArn into DescribeType to monitor the current test status and test status description for the extension. An extension must have a test status of PASSED before it can be published. For more information, see Publishing extensions to make them available for public use in the CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide.",
