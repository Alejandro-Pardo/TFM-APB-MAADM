Each resource can have up to 50 tags. For other limits, see Tag Naming and Usage Conventions in the AWS General Reference. You can only tag resources that are located in the specified Amazon Web Services Region for the Amazon Web Services account. To add tags to a resource, you need the necessary permissions for the service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions for adding tags. For more information, see the documentation for each service. In addition to the tag:TagResources permission required by this operation, you must also have the tagging permission defined by the service that created the resource. For example, to tag a ChimeSDKMeetings instance using the TagResources operation, you must have both of the following permissions: tag:TagResources ChimeSDKMeetings:CreateTags (dict) --- A key-value pair that you define.
