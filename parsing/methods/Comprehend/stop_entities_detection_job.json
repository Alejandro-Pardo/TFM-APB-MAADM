  "description": "Stops an entities detection job in progress. If the job state is IN_PROGRESS the job is marked for termination and put into the STOP_REQUESTED state. If the job completes before it can be stopped, it is put into the COMPLETED state; otherwise the job is stopped and put into the STOPPED state. If the job is in the COMPLETED or FAILED state when you call the StopDominantLanguageDetectionJob operation, the operation returns a 400 Internal Request Exception. When a job is stopped, any documents already processed are written to the output location.",
