  "description": "A flywheel is an Amazon Web Services resource that orchestrates the ongoing training of a model for custom classification or custom entity recognition. You can create a flywheel to start with an existing trained model, or Comprehend can create and train a new model. When you create the flywheel, Comprehend creates a data lake in your account. The data lake holds the training data and test data for all versions of the model. To use a flywheel with an existing trained model, you specify the active model version. Comprehend copies the model's training data and test data into the flywheel's data lake. To use the flywheel with a new model, you need to provide a dataset for training data (and optional test data) when you create the flywheel. For more information about flywheels, see Flywheel overview in the Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide.",
