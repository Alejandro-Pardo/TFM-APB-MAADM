  "description": "Deletes an entity recognizer. Only those recognizers that are in terminated states (IN_ERROR, TRAINED) will be deleted. If an active inference job is using the model, a ResourceInUseException will be returned. This is an asynchronous action that puts the recognizer into a DELETING state, and it is then removed by a background job. Once removed, the recognizer disappears from your account and is no longer available for use.",
