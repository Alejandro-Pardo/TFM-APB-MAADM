(string) --- disableSSO (boolean) --- If you set this parameter to true, Amazon AppFlow bypasses the single sign-on (SSO) settings in your SAP account when it accesses your SAP OData instance. Whether you need this option depends on the types of credentials that you applied to your SAP OData connection profile. If your profile uses basic authentication credentials, SAP SSO can prevent Amazon AppFlow from connecting to your account with your username and password.
