  "description": "Creates a Amazon CloudWatch RUM app monitor, which collects telemetry data from your application and sends that data to RUM. The data includes performance and reliability information such as page load time, client-side errors, and user behavior. You use this operation only to create a new app monitor. To update an existing app monitor, use UpdateAppMonitor instead. After you create an app monitor, sign in to the CloudWatch RUM console to get the JavaScript code snippet to add to your web application. For more information, see How do I find a code snippet that I've already generated?",

      "description": "A structure that contains much of the configuration data for the app monitor. If you are using Amazon Cognito for authorization, you must include this structure in your request, and it must include the ID of the Amazon Cognito identity pool to use for authorization. If you don't include AppMonitorConfiguration, you must set up your own authorization method. For more information, see Authorize your application to send data to Amazon Web Services. If you omit this argument, the sample rate used for RUM is set to 10% of the user sessions. AllowCookies (boolean) --- If you set this to true, the RUM web client sets two cookies, a session cookie and a user cookie. The cookies allow the RUM web client to collect data relating to the number of users an application has and the behavior of the application across a sequence of events. Cookies are stored in the top-level domain of the current page. EnableXRay (boolean) --- If you set this to true, RUM enables X-Ray tracing for the user sessions that RUM samples. RUM adds an X-Ray trace header to allowed HTTP requests. It also records an X-Ray segment for allowed HTTP requests. You can see traces and segments from these user sessions in the X-Ray console and the CloudWatch ServiceLens console. For more information, see What is X-Ray? ExcludedPages (list) --- A list of URLs in your website or application to exclude from RUM data collection. You can't include both ExcludedPages and IncludedPages in the same operation. (string) --- FavoritePages (list) --- A list of pages in your application that are to be displayed with a 'favorite' icon in the CloudWatch RUM console. (string) --- GuestRoleArn (string) --- The ARN of the guest IAM role that is attached to the Amazon Cognito identity pool that is used to authorize the sending of data to RUM. IdentityPoolId (string) --- The ID of the Amazon Cognito identity pool that is used to authorize the sending of data to RUM. IncludedPages (list) --- If this app monitor is to collect data from only certain pages in your application, this structure lists those pages. (string) --- SessionSampleRate (float) --- Specifies the portion of user sessions to use for RUM data collection. Choosing a higher portion gives you more data but also incurs more costs. The range for this value is 0 to 1 inclusive. Setting this to 1 means that 100% of user sessions are sampled, and setting it to 0.1 means that 10% of user sessions are sampled. If you omit this parameter, the default of 0.1 is used, and 10% of sessions will be sampled. Telemetries (list) --- An array that lists the types of telemetry data that this app monitor is to collect. errors indicates that RUM collects data about unhandled JavaScript errors raised by your application. performance indicates that RUM collects performance data about how your application and its resources are loaded and rendered. This includes Core Web Vitals. http indicates that RUM collects data about HTTP errors thrown by your application. (string) ---",
