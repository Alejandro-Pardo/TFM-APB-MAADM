You can add datasets to the dataset group when you create the dataset group, or later by using the UpdateDatasetGroup operation. After creating a dataset group and adding datasets, you use the dataset group when you create a predictor. For more information, see Dataset groups. To get a list of all your datasets groups, use the ListDatasetGroups operation.",

The following basic restrictions apply to tags: Maximum number of tags per resource - 50. For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value. Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8. Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8. If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values are case sensitive. Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit. (dict) --- The optional metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize and organize them. One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is a general label that acts like a category for more specific tag values. The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).",
