(list) --- (dict) --- A filter used to determine which webhooks trigger a build. The type of webhook filter. There are 11 webhook filter types: EVENT, ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID, HEAD_REF, BASE_REF, FILE_PATH, COMMIT_MESSAGE, TAG_NAME, RELEASE_NAME, REPOSITORY_NAME, ORGANIZATION_NAME, and WORKFLOW_NAME. EVENT A webhook event triggers a build when the provided pattern matches one of nine event types: PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED, PULL_REQUEST_CLOSED, PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED, PULL_REQUEST_MERGED, RELEASED, PRERELEASED, and WORKFLOW_JOB_QUEUED. The EVENT patterns are specified as a comma-separated string. For example, PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED filters all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events. ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID A webhook event triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket account ID matches the regular expression pattern. HEAD_REF A webhook event triggers a build when the head reference matches the regular expression pattern. For example, refs/heads/branch-name and refs/tags/tag-name. BASE_REF A webhook event triggers a build when the base reference matches the regular expression pattern. For example, refs/heads/branch-name. FILE_PATH A webhook triggers a build when the path of a changed file matches the regular expression pattern. COMMIT_MESSAGE A webhook triggers a build when the head commit message matches the regular expression pattern. TAG_NAME A webhook triggers a build when the tag name of the release matches the regular expression pattern. RELEASE_NAME A webhook triggers a build when the release name matches the regular expression pattern. REPOSITORY_NAME A webhook triggers a build when the repository name matches the regular expression pattern. ORGANIZATION_NAME A webhook triggers a build when the organization name matches the regular expression pattern. WORKFLOW_NAME A webhook triggers a build when the workflow name matches the regular expression pattern. For a WebHookFilter that uses EVENT type, a comma-separated string that specifies one or more events. For example, the webhook filter PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED allows all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events to trigger a build. For a WebHookFilter that uses any of the other filter types, a regular expression pattern. For example, a WebHookFilter that uses HEAD_REF for its type and the pattern ^refs/heads/ triggers a build when the head reference is a branch with a reference name refs/heads/branch-name. excludeMatchedPattern (boolean) --- Used to indicate that the pattern determines which webhook events do not trigger a build.
