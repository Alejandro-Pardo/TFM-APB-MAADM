CODECOMMIT: The source code is in an CodeCommit repository. CODEPIPELINE: The source code settings are specified in the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline. GITHUB: The source code is in a GitHub repository. GITHUB_ENTERPRISE: The source code is in a GitHub Enterprise Server repository. GITLAB: The source code is in a GitLab repository. GITLAB_SELF_MANAGED: The source code is in a self-managed GitLab repository. NO_SOURCE: The project does not have input source code. S3: The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket. location (string) --- Information about the location of the source code to be built. Valid values include: For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline, location should not be specified. If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores it. This is because CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. For source code in an CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the buildspec file (for example, https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name>). For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the following. The path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, <bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip). The path to the folder that contains the source code (for example, <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/). For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon Web Services account to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub Authorize application page, for Organization access, choose Request access next to each repository you want to allow CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose Authorize application. (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to use this connection, in the source object, set the auth object's type value to OAUTH. For source code in an GitLab or self-managed GitLab repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon Web Services account to your GitLab account. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitLab, on the Connections Authorize application page, choose Authorize. Then on the CodeConnections Create GitLab connection page, choose Connect to GitLab. (After you have connected to your GitLab account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to override the default connection and use this connection instead, set the auth object's type value to CODECONNECTIONS in the source object. For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon Web Services account to your Bitbucket account. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket Confirm access to your account page, choose Grant access. (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. If you specify CODEPIPELINE for the Type property, don't specify this property.

The bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see Buildspec File Name and Storage Location. auth (dict) --- Information about the authorization settings for CodeBuild to access the source code to be built. The authorization type to use. Valid options are OAUTH, CODECONNECTIONS, or SECRETS_MANAGER. resource (string) --- The resource value that applies to the specified authorization type. reportBuildStatus (boolean) --- Set to true to report the status of a build's start and finish to your source provider. This option is valid only when your source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self Managed, GitLab, GitLab Self Managed, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use a different source provider, an invalidInputException is thrown. To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see Source provider access in the CodeBuild User Guide. The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider. If your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you must push a new commit to the repo for a change to this property to take effect. buildStatusConfig (dict) --- Contains information that defines how the build project reports the build status to the source provider. This option is only used when the source provider is GITHUB, GITHUB_ENTERPRISE, or BITBUCKET. context (string) --- Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter depends on the source provider. Bitbucket This parameter is used for the name parameter in the Bitbucket commit status. For more information, see build in the Bitbucket API documentation. GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server This parameter is used for the context parameter in the GitHub commit status. For more information, see Create a commit status in the GitHub developer guide. targetUrl (string) --- Specifies the target url of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. Bitbucket This parameter is used for the url parameter in the Bitbucket commit status. GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server This parameter is used for the target_url parameter in the GitHub commit status. insecureSsl (boolean) --- Enable this flag to ignore SSL warnings while connecting to the project source code. sourceIdentifier (string) --- An identifier for this project source.

This property can be one of the following values: NONE The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default. READ_ONLY The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects. FULL The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria: If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner preferred setting, the bucket owner owns the objects.

This is because CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of CodeBuild. If type is set to S3, this is the path to the output artifact. If path is not specified, path is not used.

For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts, namespaceType is set to BUILD_ID, and name is set to MyArtifact.zip, the output artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/MyArtifact.zip. name (string) --- Along with path and namespaceType, the pattern that CodeBuild uses to name and store the output artifact: If type is set to CODEPIPELINE, CodePipeline ignores this value if specified. If type is set to S3, this is the name of the output artifact object. If you set the name to be a forward slash ('/'), the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.

This is because CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of CodeBuild.

By default S3 build logs are encrypted. bucketOwnerAccess (string) --- Specifies the bucket owner's access for objects that another account uploads to their Amazon S3 bucket. By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects. This property can be one of the following values: NONE The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default. READ_ONLY The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership of the objects. FULL The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the following criteria: If the bucket is configured with the Bucket owner preferred setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading account will have object access as specified by the bucket's policy. Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects. For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see Controlling ownership of uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.",
