  "description": "Creates an EKS Pod Identity association between a service account in an Amazon EKS cluster and an IAM role with EKS Pod Identity. Use EKS Pod Identity to give temporary IAM credentials to pods and the credentials are rotated automatically. Amazon EKS Pod Identity associations provide the ability to manage credentials for your applications, similar to the way that Amazon EC2 instance profiles provide credentials to Amazon EC2 instances. If a pod uses a service account that has an association, Amazon EKS sets environment variables in the containers of the pod. The environment variables configure the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including the Command Line Interface, to use the EKS Pod Identity credentials. Pod Identity is a simpler method than IAM roles for service accounts, as this method doesn't use OIDC identity providers. Additionally, you can configure a role for Pod Identity once, and reuse it across clusters.",
