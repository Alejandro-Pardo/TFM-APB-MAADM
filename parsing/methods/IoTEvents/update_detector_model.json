The default action payload contains all attribute-value pairs that have the information about the detector model instance and the event that triggered the action. You can customize the payload. One column of the DynamoDB table receives all attribute-value pairs in the payload that you specify. For more information, see Actions in AWS IoT Events Developer Guide. hashKeyType (string) --- The data type for the hash key (also called the partition key). You can specify the following values: 'STRING' - The hash key is a string. 'NUMBER' - The hash key is a number. If you don't specify hashKeyType, the default value is 'STRING'.

You must use an expression, and the evaluated result should be a Boolean value. timestamp (dict) --- The timestamp associated with the asset property value. The default is the current event time. The timestamp, in seconds, in the Unix epoch format. The valid range is between 1-31556889864403199. offsetInNanos (string) --- The nanosecond offset converted from timeInSeconds. The valid range is between 0-999999999. quality (string) --- The quality of the asset property value. The value must be 'GOOD', 'BAD', or 'UNCERTAIN'. transitionEvents (list) --- Specifies the actions performed, and the next state entered, when a condition evaluates to TRUE. (dict) --- Specifies the actions performed and the next state entered when a condition evaluates to TRUE. The name of the transition event. Required. A Boolean expression that when TRUE causes the actions to be performed and the nextState to be entered. The next state to enter. onEnter (dict) --- When entering this state, perform these actions if the condition is TRUE. events (list) --- Specifies the actions that are performed when the state is entered and the condition is TRUE. onExit (dict) --- When exiting this state, perform these actions if the specified condition is TRUE. events (list) --- Specifies the actions that are performed when the state is exited and the condition is TRUE.
