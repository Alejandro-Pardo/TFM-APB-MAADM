After the presigned URL is created, no additional permission is required to access this URL. IAM authorization policies for this API are also enforced for every HTTP request that attempts to connect to the extension. You control the amount of time that the URL will be valid using the SessionExpirationDurationInSeconds parameter. If you do not provide this parameter, the returned URL is valid for twelve hours.",
