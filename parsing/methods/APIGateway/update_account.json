(dict) --- For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch Operations. op (string) --- An update operation to be performed with this PATCH request. The valid value can be add, remove, replace or copy. Not all valid operations are supported for a given resource. Support of the operations depends on specific operational contexts. Attempts to apply an unsupported operation on a resource will return an error message.. path (string) --- The op operation's target, as identified by a JSON Pointer value that references a location within the targeted resource. For example, if the target resource has an updateable property of {'name':'value'}, the path for this property is /name. If the name property value is a JSON object (e.g., {'name': {'child/name': 'child-value'}}), the path for the child/name property will be /name/child~1name. Any slash ('/') character appearing in path names must be escaped with '~1', as shown in the example above. Each op operation can have only one path associated with it. value (string) --- The new target value of the update operation. It is applicable for the add or replace operation. When using AWS CLI to update a property of a JSON value, enclose the JSON object with a pair of single quotes in a Linux shell, e.g., --\u0098{'a': --\u00a6}'. from (string) --- The copy update operation's source as identified by a JSON-Pointer value referencing the location within the targeted resource to copy the value from. For example, to promote a canary deployment, you copy the canary deployment ID to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on a Stage resource with 'op':'copy', 'from':'/canarySettings/deploymentId' and 'path':'/deploymentId'.",
