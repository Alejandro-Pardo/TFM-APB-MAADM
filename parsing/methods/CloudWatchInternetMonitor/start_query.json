TOP_LOCATIONS: Provides availability score, performance score, total traffic, and time to first byte (TTFB) information, for the top location and ASN combinations that you're monitoring, by traffic volume. TOP_LOCATION_DETAILS: Provides TTFB for Amazon CloudFront, your current configuration, and the best performing EC2 configuration, at 1 hour intervals. OVERALL_TRAFFIC_SUGGESTIONS: Provides TTFB, using a 30-day weighted average, for all traffic in each Amazon Web Services location that is monitored. OVERALL_TRAFFIC_SUGGESTIONS_DETAILS: Provides TTFB, using a 30-day weighted average, for each top location, for a proposed Amazon Web Services location. Must provide an Amazon Web Services location to search. ROUTING_SUGGESTIONS: Provides the predicted average round-trip time (RTT) from an IP prefix toward an Amazon Web Services location for a DNS resolver. The RTT is calculated at one hour intervals, over a one hour period.
