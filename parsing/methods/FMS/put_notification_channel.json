To perform this action outside of the console, you must first configure the SNS topic's access policy to allow the SnsRoleName to publish SNS logs. If the SnsRoleName provided is a role other than the AWSServiceRoleForFMS service-linked role, this role must have a trust relationship configured to allow the Firewall Manager service principal fms.amazonaws.com to assume this role. For information about configuring an SNS access policy, see Service roles for Firewall Manager in the Firewall Manager Developer Guide.",
