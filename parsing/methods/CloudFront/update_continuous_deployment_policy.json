SingleWeightConfig (dict) --- Contains the percentage of traffic to send to the staging distribution. The percentage of traffic to send to a staging distribution, expressed as a decimal number between 0 and 0.15. For example, a value of 0.10 means 10% of traffic is sent to the staging distribution. SessionStickinessConfig (dict) --- Session stickiness provides the ability to define multiple requests from a single viewer as a single session. This prevents the potentially inconsistent experience of sending some of a given user's requests to your staging distribution, while others are sent to your primary distribution. Define the session duration using TTL values. The amount of time after which you want sessions to cease if no requests are received. Allowed values are 300---3600 seconds (5---60 minutes). The value must be less than or equal to MaximumTTL. The maximum amount of time to consider requests from the viewer as being part of the same session. The value must be greater than or equal to IdleTTL. SingleHeaderConfig (dict) --- Determines which HTTP requests are sent to the staging distribution.
