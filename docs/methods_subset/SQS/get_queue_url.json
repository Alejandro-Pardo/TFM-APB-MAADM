To access a queue owned by another Amazon Web Services account, use the QueueOwnerAWSAccountId parameter to specify the account ID of the queue's owner. Note that the queue owner must grant you the necessary permissions to access the queue. For more information about accessing shared queues, see the AddPermission API or Allow developers to write messages to a shared queue in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.",
