    {
      "name": "QueueUrl",
      "type": "string",

      "name": "AttributeNames",
      "type": "list",
      "required": false,
      "description": "A list of attributes for which to retrieve information. The AttributeNames parameter is optional, but if you don't specify values for this parameter, the request returns empty results. The following attributes are supported: All --- Returns all values. ApproximateNumberOfMessages --- Returns the approximate number of messages available for retrieval from the queue. ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed --- Returns the approximate number of messages in the queue that are delayed and not available for reading immediately. This can happen when the queue is configured as a delay queue or when a message has been sent with a delay parameter. ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible --- Returns the approximate number of messages that are in flight. Messages are considered to be in flight if they have been sent to a client but have not yet been deleted or have not yet reached the end of their visibility window. CreatedTimestamp --- Returns the time when the queue was created in seconds ( epoch time). DelaySeconds --- Returns the default delay on the queue in seconds. LastModifiedTimestamp --- Returns the time when the queue was last changed in seconds ( epoch time). MaximumMessageSize --- Returns the limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. MessageRetentionPeriod --- Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the MessageRetentionPeriod attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and deleted if the MessageRetentionPeriod is reduced below the age of existing messages. Policy --- Returns the policy of the queue. QueueArn --- Returns the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the queue. ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds --- Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which the ReceiveMessage action waits for a message to arrive. VisibilityTimeout --- Returns the visibility timeout for the queue. For more information about the visibility timeout, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. The following attributes apply only to dead-letter queues: RedrivePolicy --- The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows: deadLetterTargetArn --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded. maxReceiveCount --- The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. Default: 10. When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the maxReceiveCount for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue. RedriveAllowPolicy --- The string that includes the parameters for the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive permission and which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows: redrivePermission --- The permission type that defines which source queues can specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue. Valid values are: allowAll --- (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web Services account in the same Region can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue. denyAll --- No source queues can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue. byQueue --- Only queues specified by the sourceQueueArns parameter can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue. sourceQueueArns --- The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the source queues that can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue and redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only when the redrivePermission parameter is set to byQueue. You can specify up to 10 source queue ARNs. To allow more than 10 source queues to specify dead-letter queues, set the redrivePermission parameter to allowAll. The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption: KmsMasterKeyId --- Returns the ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms. KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds --- Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. For more information, see How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?. SqsManagedSseEnabled --- Returns information about whether the queue is using SSE-SQS encryption using SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option is supported per queue (for example, SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS). The following attributes apply only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues: FifoQueue --- Returns information about whether the queue is FIFO. For more information, see FIFO queue logic in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. ContentBasedDeduplication --- Returns whether content-based deduplication is enabled for the queue. For more information, see Exactly-once processing in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. The following attributes apply only to high throughput for FIFO queues: DeduplicationScope --- Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup and queue. FifoThroughputLimit --- Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are perQueue and perMessageGroupId. The perMessageGroupId value is allowed only when the value for DeduplicationScope is messageGroup. To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following: Set DeduplicationScope to messageGroup. Set FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId. If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified. For information on throughput quotas, see Quotas related to messages in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. (string) ---",
