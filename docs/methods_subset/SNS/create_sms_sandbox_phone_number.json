  "description": "Adds a destination phone number to an Amazon Web Services account in the SMS sandbox and sends a one-time password (OTP) to that phone number. When you start using Amazon SNS to send SMS messages, your Amazon Web Services account is in the SMS sandbox. The SMS sandbox provides a safe environment for you to try Amazon SNS features without risking your reputation as an SMS sender. While your Amazon Web Services account is in the SMS sandbox, you can use all of the features of Amazon SNS. However, you can send SMS messages only to verified destination phone numbers. For more information, including how to move out of the sandbox to send messages without restrictions, see SMS sandbox in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.",
