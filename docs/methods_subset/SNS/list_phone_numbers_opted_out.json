  "description": "Returns a list of phone numbers that are opted out, meaning you cannot send SMS messages to them. The results for ListPhoneNumbersOptedOut are paginated, and each page returns up to 100 phone numbers. If additional phone numbers are available after the first page of results, then a NextToken string will be returned. To receive the next page, you call ListPhoneNumbersOptedOut again using the NextToken string received from the previous call. When there are no more records to return, NextToken will be null.",
