  "description": "Describes the progress of the AMI store tasks. You can describe the store tasks for specified AMIs. If you don't specify the AMIs, you get a paginated list of store tasks from the last 31 days. For each AMI task, the response indicates if the task is InProgress, Completed, or Failed. For tasks InProgress, the response shows the estimated progress as a percentage. Tasks are listed in reverse chronological order. Currently, only tasks from the past 31 days can be viewed. To use this API, you must have the required permissions. For more information, see Permissions for storing and restoring AMIs using Amazon S3 in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. For more information, see Store and restore an AMI using Amazon S3 in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.",
