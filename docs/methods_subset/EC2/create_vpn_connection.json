  "description": "Creates a VPN connection between an existing virtual private gateway or transit gateway and a customer gateway. The supported connection type is ipsec.1. The response includes information that you need to give to your network administrator to configure your customer gateway. If you decide to shut down your VPN connection for any reason and later create a new VPN connection, you must reconfigure your customer gateway with the new information returned from this call. This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once, Amazon EC2 doesn't return an error. For more information, see Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN in the Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN User Guide.",
