Only valid for managed network interfaces, where managed is true. owner-id - The Amazon Web Services account ID of the network interface owner. private-dns-name - The private DNS name of the network interface (IPv4). private-ip-address - The private IPv4 address or addresses of the network interface. requester-id - The alias or Amazon Web Services account ID of the principal or service that created the network interface. requester-managed - Indicates whether the network interface is being managed by an Amazon Web Services service (for example, Amazon Web Services Management Console, Auto Scaling, and so on). source-dest-check - Indicates whether the network interface performs source/destination checking. A value of true means checking is enabled, and false means checking is disabled. The value must be false for the network interface to perform network address translation (NAT) in your VPC. status - The status of the network interface. If the network interface is not attached to an instance, the status is available; if a network interface is attached to an instance the status is in-use. subnet-id - The ID of the subnet for the network interface. tag:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA, specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value. tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value. vpc-id - The ID of the VPC for the network interface. (dict) --- A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an AND, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters. For more information, see List and filter using the CLI and API in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Name (string) --- The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive. Values (list) --- The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an OR, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values. (string) ---",
