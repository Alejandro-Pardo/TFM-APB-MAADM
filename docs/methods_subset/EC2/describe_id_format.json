  "description": "Describes the ID format settings for your resources on a per-Region basis, for example, to view which resource types are enabled for longer IDs. This request only returns information about resource types whose ID formats can be modified; it does not return information about other resource types. The following resource types support longer IDs: bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway | dhcp-options | elastic-ip-allocation | elastic-ip-association | export-task | flow-log | image | import-task | instance | internet-gateway | network-acl | network-acl-association | network-interface | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list | reservation | route-table | route-table-association | security-group | snapshot | subnet | subnet-cidr-block-association | volume | vpc | vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint | vpc-peering-connection | vpn-connection | vpn-gateway. These settings apply to the IAM user who makes the request; they do not apply to the entire Amazon Web Services account. By default, an IAM user defaults to the same settings as the root user, unless they explicitly override the settings by running the  ModifyIdFormat command. Resources created with longer IDs are visible to all IAM users, regardless of these settings and provided that they have permission to use the relevant Describe command for the resource type.",
