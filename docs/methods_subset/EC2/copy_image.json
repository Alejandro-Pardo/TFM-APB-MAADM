  "description": "Initiates an AMI copy operation. You can copy an AMI from one Region to another, or from a Region to an Outpost. You can't copy an AMI from an Outpost to a Region, from one Outpost to another, or within the same Outpost. To copy an AMI to another partition, see CreateStoreImageTask. When you copy an AMI from one Region to another, the destination Region is the current Region. When you copy an AMI from a Region to an Outpost, specify the ARN of the Outpost as the destination. Backing snapshots copied to an Outpost are encrypted by default using the default encryption key for the Region or the key that you specify. Outposts do not support unencrypted snapshots. For information about the prerequisites when copying an AMI, see Copy an AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.",

If this parameter is not specified, your Amazon Web Services managed KMS key for Amazon EBS is used. If you specify a KMS key, you must also set the encrypted state to true. You can specify a KMS key using any of the following: Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab. Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias. Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab. Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias. Amazon Web Services authenticates the KMS key asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an identifier that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.
