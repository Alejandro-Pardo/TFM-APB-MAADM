  "description": "Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC). The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship between Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider. If you are using an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or Amazon Cognito, you don't need to create a separate IAM identity provider. These OIDC identity providers are already built-in to Amazon Web Services and are available for your use. Instead, you can move directly to creating new roles using your identity provider. To learn more, see Creating a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation in the IAM User Guide. When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following: You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP you want to use to access Amazon Web Services.",

The URL should not contain a port number. You cannot register the same provider multiple times in a single Amazon Web Services account.

However, IAM lets you have up to five thumbprints for an OIDC provider. This lets you maintain multiple thumbprints if the identity provider is rotating certificates. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, IAM will retrieve and use the top intermediate certificate authority (CA) thumbprint of the OpenID Connect identity provider server certificate. The server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the X.509 certificate used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. It is always a 40-character string. For example, assume that the OIDC provider is server.example.com and the provider stores its keys at https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect. In that case, the thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the certificate used by https://keys.server.example.com. For more information about obtaining the OIDC provider thumbprint, see Obtaining the thumbprint for an OpenID Connect provider in the IAM user Guide.

The identity provider's server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the self-signed X.509 certificate.
