  "description": "Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3 This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts. This action performs the following types of requests: For more information about the S3 structure in the request body, see the following: To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:RestoreObject action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify. For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version. When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the Tier element of the request body: For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for Expedited data access, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide. You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore in the Amazon S3 User Guide. To get the status of object restoration, you can send a HEAD request. Operations return the x-amz-restore header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications in the Amazon S3 User Guide. After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object. If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration and Object Lifecycle Management in Amazon S3 User Guide. A successful action returns either the 200 OK or 202 Accepted status code. The following operations are related to RestoreObject:",

Access points - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias.

Retrieval tier at which the restore will be processed. Type (string) --- Type of restore request. Tier (string) --- Retrieval tier at which the restore will be processed. Description (string) --- The optional description for the job. SelectParameters (dict) --- Describes the parameters for Select job types. Describes the serialization format of the object. CSV (dict) --- Describes the serialization of a CSV-encoded object. FileHeaderInfo (string) --- Describes the first line of input. Valid values are: NONE: First line is not a header. IGNORE: First line is a header, but you can't use the header values to indicate the column in an expression. You can use column position (such as _1, _2, --\u00a6) to indicate the column ( SELECT s._1 FROM OBJECT s). Use: First line is a header, and you can use the header value to identify a column in an expression ( SELECT \"name\" FROM OBJECT). Comments (string) --- A single character used to indicate that a row should be ignored when the character is present at the start of that row. You can specify any character to indicate a comment line. The default character is #. Default: # QuoteEscapeCharacter (string) --- A single character used for escaping the quotation mark character inside an already escaped value.
