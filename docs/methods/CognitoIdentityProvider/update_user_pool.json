This trigger is an opportunity to customize all SMS and email messages from your user pool. When a custom message trigger is active, your user pool routes all messages to a Lambda function that returns a runtime-customized message subject and body for your user pool to deliver to a user. PostConfirmation (string) --- The configuration of a post confirmation Lambda trigger in a user pool. This trigger can take custom actions after a user confirms their user account and their email address or phone number. PreAuthentication (string) --- The configuration of a pre authentication trigger in a user pool. This trigger can evaluate and modify user sign-in events. PostAuthentication (string) --- The configuration of a post authentication Lambda trigger in a user pool. This trigger can take custom actions after a user signs in. DefineAuthChallenge (string) --- The configuration of a define auth challenge Lambda trigger, one of three triggers in the sequence of the custom authentication challenge triggers. CreateAuthChallenge (string) --- The configuration of a create auth challenge Lambda trigger, one of three triggers in the sequence of the custom authentication challenge triggers. VerifyAuthChallengeResponse (string) --- The configuration of a verify auth challenge Lambda trigger, one of three triggers in the sequence of the custom authentication challenge triggers. PreTokenGeneration (string) --- The legacy configuration of a pre token generation Lambda trigger in a user pool. Set this parameter for legacy purposes. If you also set an ARN in PreTokenGenerationConfig, its value must be identical to PreTokenGeneration. For new instances of pre token generation triggers, set the LambdaArn of PreTokenGenerationConfig. UserMigration (string) --- The configuration of a migrate user Lambda trigger in a user pool. This trigger can create user profiles when users sign in or attempt to reset their password with credentials that don't exist yet. PreTokenGenerationConfig (dict) --- The detailed configuration of a pre token generation Lambda trigger in a user pool.

CustomEmailSender (dict) --- The configuration of a custom email sender Lambda trigger.

You can set a verified email address, but not an address in a verified domain, in the Amazon Cognito console. Amazon Cognito uses the email address that you provide in one of the following ways, depending on the value that you specify for the EmailSendingAccount parameter: If you specify COGNITO_DEFAULT, Amazon Cognito uses this address as the custom FROM address when it emails your users using its built-in email account. If you specify DEVELOPER, Amazon Cognito emails your users with this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf. The Region value of the SourceArn parameter must indicate a supported Amazon Web Services Region of your user pool. Typically, the Region in the SourceArn and the user pool Region are the same. For more information, see Amazon SES email configuration regions in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide.

To look up the email delivery limit for the default option, see Limits in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide. The default FROM address is no-reply@verificationemail.com. To customize the FROM address, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon SES verified email address for the SourceArn parameter.
