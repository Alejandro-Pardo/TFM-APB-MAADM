  "description": "Some API operations in a user pool generate a challenge, like a prompt for an MFA code, for device authentication that bypasses MFA, or for a custom authentication challenge. A RespondToAuthChallenge API request provides the answer to that challenge, like a code or a secure remote password (SRP). The parameters of a response to an authentication challenge vary with the type of challenge.

Possible challenges include the following: WEB_AUTHN: Respond to the challenge with the results of a successful authentication with a WebAuthn authenticator, or passkey. Examples of WebAuthn authenticators include biometric devices and security keys. PASSWORD: Respond with USER_PASSWORD_AUTH parameters: USERNAME (required), PASSWORD (required), SECRET_HASH (required if the app client is configured with a client secret), DEVICE_KEY. PASSWORD_SRP: Respond with USER_SRP_AUTH parameters: USERNAME (required), SRP_A (required), SECRET_HASH (required if the app client is configured with a client secret), DEVICE_KEY. SELECT_CHALLENGE: Respond to the challenge with USERNAME and an ANSWER that matches one of the challenge types in the AvailableChallenges response parameter. SMS_MFA: Respond with an SMS_MFA_CODE that your user pool delivered in an SMS message. EMAIL_OTP: Respond with an EMAIL_OTP_CODE that your user pool delivered in an email message. PASSWORD_VERIFIER: Respond with PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE, PASSWORD_CLAIM_SECRET_BLOCK, and TIMESTAMP after client-side SRP calculations. CUSTOM_CHALLENGE: This is returned if your custom authentication flow determines that the user should pass another challenge before tokens are issued. The parameters of the challenge are determined by your Lambda function. DEVICE_SRP_AUTH: Respond with the initial parameters of device SRP authentication. For more information, see Signing in with a device. DEVICE_PASSWORD_VERIFIER: Respond with PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE, PASSWORD_CLAIM_SECRET_BLOCK, and TIMESTAMP after client-side SRP calculations. NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED: For users who are required to change their passwords after successful first login. Respond to this challenge with NEW_PASSWORD and any required attributes that Amazon Cognito returned in the requiredAttributes parameter. You can also set values for attributes that aren't required by your user pool and that your app client can write. Amazon Cognito only returns this challenge for users who have temporary passwords. When you create passwordless users, you must provide values for all required attributes. MFA_SETUP: For users who are required to setup an MFA factor before they can sign in. The MFA types activated for the user pool will be listed in the challenge parameters MFAS_CAN_SETUP value. To set up time-based one-time password (TOTP) MFA, use the session returned in this challenge from InitiateAuth or AdminInitiateAuth as an input to AssociateSoftwareToken. Then, use the session returned by VerifySoftwareToken as an input to RespondToAuthChallenge or AdminRespondToAuthChallenge with challenge name MFA_SETUP to complete sign-in. To set up SMS or email MFA, collect a phone_number or email attribute for the user. Then restart the authentication flow with an InitiateAuth or AdminInitiateAuth request.",
