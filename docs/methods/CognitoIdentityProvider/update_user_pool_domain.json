  "description": "A user pool domain hosts managed login, an authorization server and web server for authentication in your application. This operation updates the branding version for user pool domains between 1 for hosted UI (classic) and 2 for managed login. It also updates the SSL certificate for user pool custom domains. Changes to the domain branding version take up to one minute to take effect for a prefix domain and up to five minutes for a custom domain. This operation doesn't change the name of your user pool domain. To change your domain, delete it with DeleteUserPoolDomain and create a new domain with CreateUserPoolDomain. You can pass the ARN of a new Certificate Manager certificate in this request. Typically, ACM certificates automatically renew and you user pool can continue to use the same ARN. But if you generate a new certificate for your custom domain name, replace the original configuration with the new ARN in this request. ACM certificates for custom domains must be in the US East (N. Virginia) Amazon Web Services Region. After you submit your request, Amazon Cognito requires up to 1 hour to distribute your new certificate to your custom domain. For more information about adding a custom domain to your user pool, see Configuring a user pool domain.",
