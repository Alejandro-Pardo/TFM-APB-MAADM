  "description": "Configures the branding settings for a user pool style. This operation is the programmatic option for the configuration of a style in the branding designer. Provides values for UI customization in a Settings JSON object and image files in an Assets array.

Amazon Cognito doesn't require that you pass all parameters in one request and preserves existing style settings that you don't specify. If your request is larger than 2MB, separate it into multiple requests, each with a size smaller than the limit.",
