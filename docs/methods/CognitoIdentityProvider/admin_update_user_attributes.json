For custom attributes, you must add a custom: prefix to the attribute name, for example custom:department. This operation can set a user's email address or phone number as verified and permit immediate sign-in in user pools that require verification of these attributes. To do this, set the email_verified or phone_number_verified attribute to true.",

If your user pool requires verification before Amazon Cognito updates an attribute value that you specify in this request, Amazon Cognito doesn't immediately update the value of that attribute. After your user receives and responds to a verification message to verify the new value, Amazon Cognito updates the attribute value. Your user can sign in and receive messages with the original attribute value until they verify the new value. To skip the verification message and update the value of an attribute that requires verification in the same API request, include the email_verified or phone_number_verified attribute, with a value of true. If you set the email_verified or phone_number_verified value for an email or phone_number attribute that requires verification to true, Amazon Cognito doesn't send a verification message to your user.

You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminUpdateUserAttributes API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the custom message trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminUpdateUserAttributes request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.
