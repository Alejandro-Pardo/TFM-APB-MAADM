  "description": "Updates the status of a user's device so that it is marked as remembered or not remembered for the purpose of device authentication. Device authentication is a 'remember me' mechanism that silently completes sign-in from trusted devices with a device key instead of a user-provided MFA code. This operation changes the status of a device without deleting it, so you can enable it again later. For more information about device authentication, see Working with devices.",
