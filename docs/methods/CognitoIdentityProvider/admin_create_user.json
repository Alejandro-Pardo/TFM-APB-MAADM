  "description": "Creates a new user in the specified user pool. If MessageAction isn't set, the default is to send a welcome message via email or phone (SMS). This message is based on a template that you configured in your call to create or update a user pool. This template includes your custom sign-up instructions and placeholders for user name and temporary password. Alternatively, you can call AdminCreateUser with SUPPRESS for the MessageAction parameter, and Amazon Cognito won't send any email. In either case, if the user has a password, they will be in the FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD state until they sign in and set their password. Your invitation message template must have the {####} password placeholder if your users have passwords. If your template doesn't have this placeholder, Amazon Cognito doesn't deliver the invitation message. In this case, you must update your message template and resend the password with a new AdminCreateUser request with a MessageAction value of RESEND.",

For custom attributes, you must prepend the custom: prefix to the attribute name. To send a message inviting the user to sign up, you must specify the user's email address or phone number. You can do this in your call to AdminCreateUser or in the Users tab of the Amazon Cognito console for managing your user pools. You must also provide an email address or phone number when you expect the user to do passwordless sign-in with an email or SMS OTP. These attributes must be provided when passwordless options are the only available, or when you don't submit a TemporaryPassword. In your AdminCreateUser request, you can set the email_verified and phone_number_verified attributes to true. The following conditions apply: email The email address where you want the user to receive their confirmation code and username. You must provide a value for email when you want to set email_verified to true, or if you set EMAIL in the DesiredDeliveryMediums parameter. phone_number The phone number where you want the user to receive their confirmation code and username.
