  "description": "Updates the status of a the currently signed-in user's device so that it is marked as remembered or not remembered for the purpose of device authentication. Device authentication is a 'remember me' mechanism that silently completes sign-in from trusted devices with a device key instead of a user-provided MFA code. This operation changes the status of a device without deleting it, so you can enable it again later. For more information about device authentication, see Working with devices. Authorize this action with a signed-in user's access token. It must include the scope aws.cognito.signin.user.admin.",
