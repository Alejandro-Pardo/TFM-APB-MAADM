  "description": "Provides the feedback for an authentication event generated by threat protection features. The user's response indicates that you think that the event either was from a valid user or was an unwanted authentication attempt. This feedback improves the risk evaluation decision for the user pool as part of Amazon Cognito threat protection. To activate this setting, your user pool must be on the Plus tier. This operation requires a FeedbackToken that Amazon Cognito generates and adds to notification emails when users have potentially suspicious authentication events. Users invoke this operation when they select the link that corresponds to {one-click-link-valid} or {one-click-link-invalid} in your notification template. Because FeedbackToken is a required parameter, you can' make requests to UpdateAuthEventFeedback without the contents of the notification email message.",
