  "description": "Sets the specified user's password in a user pool. This operation administratively sets a temporary or permanent password for a user. With this operation, you can bypass self-service password changes and permit immediate sign-in with the password that you set. To do this, set Permanent to true. You can also set a new temporary password in this request, send it to a user, and require them to choose a new password on their next sign-in. To do this, set Permanent to false. If the password is temporary, the user's Status becomes FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD. When the user next tries to sign in, the InitiateAuth or AdminInitiateAuth response includes the NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED challenge. If the user doesn't sign in before the temporary password expires, they can no longer sign in and you must repeat this operation to set a temporary or permanent password for them. After the user sets a new password, or if you set a permanent password, their status becomes Confirmed. AdminSetUserPassword can set a password for the user profile that Amazon Cognito creates for third-party federated users. When you set a password, the federated user's status changes from EXTERNAL_PROVIDER to CONFIRMED. A user in this state can sign in as a federated user, and initiate authentication flows in the API like a linked native user. They can also modify their password and attributes in token-authenticated API requests like ChangePassword and UpdateUserAttributes. As a best security practice and to keep users in sync with your external IdP, don't set passwords on federated user profiles. To set up a federated user for native sign-in with a linked native user, refer to Linking federated users to an existing user profile.",
