If your user pool configuration includes triggers, the AdminConfirmSignUp API action invokes the Lambda function that is specified for the post confirmation trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. In this payload, the clientMetadata attribute provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminConfirmSignUp request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the ClientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.
