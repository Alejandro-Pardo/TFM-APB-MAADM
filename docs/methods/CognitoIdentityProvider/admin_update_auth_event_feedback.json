  "description": "Provides the feedback for an authentication event generated by threat protection features. Your response indicates that you think that the event either was from a valid user or was an unwanted authentication attempt. This feedback improves the risk evaluation decision for the user pool as part of Amazon Cognito threat protection. To activate this setting, your user pool must be on the Plus tier. To train the threat-protection model to recognize trusted and untrusted sign-in characteristics, configure threat protection in audit-only mode and provide a mechanism for users or administrators to submit feedback. Your feedback can tell Amazon Cognito that a risk rating was assigned at a level you don't agree with.",
