  "description": "Creates an EFS access point. An access point is an application-specific view into an EFS file system that applies an operating system user and group, and a file system path, to any file system request made through the access point. The operating system user and group override any identity information provided by the NFS client. The file system path is exposed as the access point's root directory. Applications using the access point can only access data in the application's own directory and any subdirectories. To learn more, see Mounting a file system using EFS access points. This operation requires permissions for the elasticfilesystem:CreateAccessPoint action. Access points can be tagged on creation. If tags are specified in the creation action, IAM performs additional authorization on the elasticfilesystem:TagResource action to verify if users have permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must grant explicit permissions to use the elasticfilesystem:TagResource action. For more information, see Granting permissions to tag resources during creation.",
