  "description": "The DeleteTable operation deletes a table and all of its data. After a DeleteTable request is received, the specified table is in the DELETING state until Amazon Keyspaces completes the deletion. If the table is in the ACTIVE state, you can delete it. If a table is either in the CREATING or UPDATING states, then Amazon Keyspaces returns a ResourceInUseException. If the specified table does not exist, Amazon Keyspaces returns a ResourceNotFoundException. If the table is already in the DELETING state, no error is returned.",
