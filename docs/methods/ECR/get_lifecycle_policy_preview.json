  "description": "GetLifecyclePolicyPreviewRequest request where maxResults was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the nextToken value. This value is\nnull when there are no more results to return. This option cannot be used when you specify images with imageIds. maxResults results in a single page along with a nextToken\nresponse element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another GetLifecyclePolicyPreviewRequest request with the returned nextToken\nvalue. This value can be between 1 and 1000. If this parameter is not used, then GetLifecyclePolicyPreviewRequest returns up to 100 results and a nextToken value, if applicable. This option cannot be used when you specify images with imageIds.",
