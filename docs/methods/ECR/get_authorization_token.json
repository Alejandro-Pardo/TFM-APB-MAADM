An authorization token represents your IAM authentication credentials and can be used to access any Amazon ECR registry that your IAM principal has access to. The authorization token is valid for 12 hours. The authorizationToken returned is a base64 encoded string that can be decoded and used in a docker login command to authenticate to a registry. The CLI offers an get-login-password command that simplifies the login process. For more information, see Registry authentication in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide.",
