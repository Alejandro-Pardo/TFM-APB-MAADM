This command will not delete your current shares, but prevents you from creating new shares throughout your organization. Current shares are not kept in sync with your organization structure if the structure changes after calling this API. Only the management account in the organization can call this API. You cannot call this API if there are active delegated administrators in the organization. Note that a delegated administrator is not authorized to invoke DisableAWSOrganizationsAccess.",
