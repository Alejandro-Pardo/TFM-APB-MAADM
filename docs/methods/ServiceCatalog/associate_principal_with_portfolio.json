If you share the portfolio with principal name sharing enabled, the PrincipalARN association is included in the share. The PortfolioID, PrincipalARN, and PrincipalType parameters are required.

      "description": "The ARN of the principal (user, role, or group). If the PrincipalType is IAM, the supported value is a fully defined IAM Amazon Resource Name (ARN). If the PrincipalType is IAM_PATTERN, the supported value is an IAM ARN without an AccountID in the following format: arn:partition:iam:::resource-type/resource-id The ARN resource-id can be either: A fully formed resource-id. For example, arn:aws:iam:::role/resource-name or arn:aws:iam:::role/resource-path/resource-name A wildcard ARN. The wildcard ARN accepts IAM_PATTERN values with a '*' or '?' in the resource-id segment of the ARN. For example arn:partition:service:::resource-type/resource-path/resource-name. The new symbols are exclusive to the resource-path and resource-name and cannot replace the resource-type or other ARN values. The ARN path and principal name allow unlimited wildcard characters. Examples of an acceptable wildcard ARN: arn:aws:iam:::role/ResourceName_* arn:aws:iam:::role/*/ResourceName_? Examples of an unacceptable wildcard ARN: arn:aws:iam:::*/ResourceName You can associate multiple ``IAM_PATTERN``s even if the account has no principal with that name. The '?' wildcard character matches zero or one of any character. This is similar to '.?' in regular regex context. The '*' wildcard character matches any number of any characters. This is similar to '.*' in regular regex context. In the IAM Principal ARN format (arn:partition:iam:::resource-type/resource-path/resource-name), valid resource-type values include user/, group/, or role/. The '?' and '*' characters are allowed only after the resource-type in the resource-id segment. You can use special characters anywhere within the resource-id. The '*' character also matches the '/' character, allowing paths to be formed within the resource-id. For example, arn:aws:iam:::role/*/ResourceName_? matches both arn:aws:iam:::role/pathA/pathB/ResourceName_1 and arn:aws:iam:::role/pathA/ResourceName_1.",
