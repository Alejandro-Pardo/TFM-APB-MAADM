  "description": "Creates a Rule, which contains the IPSet objects, ByteMatchSet objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to block. If you add more than one predicate to a Rule, a request must match all of the specifications to be allowed or blocked. For example, suppose that you add the following to a Rule: You then add the Rule to a WebACL and specify that you want to blocks requests that satisfy the Rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot. To create and configure a Rule, perform the following steps: For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.",
