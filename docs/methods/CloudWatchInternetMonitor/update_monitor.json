You can update a monitor to change the percentage of traffic to monitor or the maximum number of city-networks (locations and ASNs), to add or remove resources, or to change the status of the monitor. Note that you can't change the name of a monitor. The city-network maximum that you choose is the limit, but you only pay for the number of city-networks that are actually monitored.
