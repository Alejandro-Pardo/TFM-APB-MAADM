  "description": "Creates a monitor in Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor. A monitor is built based on information from the application resources that you add: VPCs, Network Load Balancers (NLBs), Amazon CloudFront distributions, and Amazon WorkSpaces directories. Internet Monitor then publishes internet measurements from Amazon Web Services that are specific to the city-networks. That is, the locations and ASNs (typically internet service providers or ISPs), where clients access your application. For more information, see Using Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. When you create a monitor, you choose the percentage of traffic that you want to monitor. You can also set a maximum limit for the number of city-networks where client traffic is monitored, that caps the total traffic that Internet Monitor monitors. A city-network maximum is the limit of city-networks, but you only pay for the number of city-networks that are actually monitored. You can update your monitor at any time to change the percentage of traffic to monitor or the city-networks maximum. For more information, see Choosing a city-network maximum value in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.",
