  "description": "Removes the specified member accounts from the behavior graph. The removed accounts no longer contribute data to the behavior graph. This operation can only be called by the administrator account for the behavior graph. For invited accounts, the removed accounts are deleted from the list of accounts in the behavior graph. To restore the account, the administrator account must send another invitation. For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph, the Detective administrator account can always enable the organization account again. Organization accounts that are not enabled as member accounts are not included in the ListMembers results for the organization behavior graph. An administrator account cannot use DeleteMembers to remove their own account from the behavior graph. To disable a behavior graph, the administrator account uses the DeleteGraph API method.",
