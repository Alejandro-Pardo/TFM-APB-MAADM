  "description": "Updates the configuration for the specified Auto Scaling group. To update an Auto Scaling group, specify the name of the group and the property that you want to change. Any properties that you don't specify are not changed by this update request. The new settings take effect on any scaling activities after this call returns. If you associate a new launch configuration or template with an Auto Scaling group, all new instances will get the updated configuration. Existing instances continue to run with the configuration that they were originally launched with. When you update a group to specify a mixed instances policy instead of a launch configuration or template, existing instances may be replaced to match the new purchasing options that you specified in the policy. For example, if the group currently has 100% On-Demand capacity and the policy specifies 50% Spot capacity, this means that half of your instances will be gradually terminated and relaunched as Spot Instances. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the old ones, so that updating your group does not compromise the performance or availability of your application. Note the following about changing DesiredCapacity, MaxSize, or MinSize: To see which properties have been set, call the DescribeAutoScalingGroups API. To view the scaling policies for an Auto Scaling group, call the DescribePolicies API. If the group has scaling policies, you can update them by calling the PutScalingPolicy API.",

      "description": "The mixed instances policy. For more information, see Auto Scaling groups with multiple instance types and purchase options in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. LaunchTemplate (dict) --- One or more launch templates and the instance types (overrides) that are used to launch EC2 instances to fulfill On-Demand and Spot capacities. LaunchTemplateSpecification (dict) --- The launch template. LaunchTemplateId (string) --- The ID of the launch template. To get the template ID, use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplates API operation. New launch templates can be created using the Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplate API. Conditional: You must specify either a LaunchTemplateId or a LaunchTemplateName. LaunchTemplateName (string) --- The name of the launch template.

To get the version number, use the Amazon EC2 DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions API operation. New launch template versions can be created using the Amazon EC2 CreateLaunchTemplateVersion API. If the value is $Latest, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the latest version of the launch template when launching instances. If the value is $Default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects the default version of the launch template when launching instances. The default value is $Default. Overrides (list) --- Any properties that you specify override the same properties in the launch template. (dict) --- Use this structure to let Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling do the following when the Auto Scaling group has a mixed instances policy: Override the instance type that is specified in the launch template. Use multiple instance types. Specify the instance types that you want, or define your instance requirements instead and let Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling provision the available instance types that meet your requirements. This can provide Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling with a larger selection of instance types to choose from when fulfilling Spot and On-Demand capacities. You can view which instance types are matched before you apply the instance requirements to your Auto Scaling group. After you define your instance requirements, you don't have to keep updating these settings to get new EC2 instance types automatically. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the instance requirements of the Auto Scaling group to determine whether a new EC2 instance type can be used. InstanceType (string) --- The instance type, such as m3.xlarge. You must specify an instance type that is supported in your requested Region and Availability Zones. For more information, see Instance types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. You can specify up to 40 instance types per Auto Scaling group. WeightedCapacity (string) --- If you provide a list of instance types to use, you can specify the number of capacity units provided by each instance type in terms of virtual CPUs, memory, storage, throughput, or other relative performance characteristic. When a Spot or On-Demand Instance is launched, the capacity units count toward the desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances until the desired capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are two units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can only launch an instance with a WeightedCapacity of five units, the instance is launched, and the desired capacity is exceeded by three units. For more information, see Configure an Auto Scaling group to use instance weights in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. Value must be in the range of 1---999. If you specify a value for WeightedCapacity for one instance type, you must specify a value for WeightedCapacity for all of them. LaunchTemplateSpecification (dict) --- Provides a launch template for the specified instance type or set of instance requirements. For example, some instance types might require a launch template with a different AMI. If not provided, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the launch template that's specified in the LaunchTemplate definition. For more information, see Specifying a different launch template for an instance type in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. You can specify up to 20 launch templates per Auto Scaling group. The launch templates specified in the overrides and in the LaunchTemplate definition count towards this limit. InstanceRequirements (dict) --- The instance requirements. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses your specified requirements to identify instance types. Then, it uses your On-Demand and Spot allocation strategies to launch instances from these instance types. You can specify up to four separate sets of instance requirements per Auto Scaling group. This is useful for provisioning instances from different Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) in the same Auto Scaling group. To do this, create the AMIs and create a new launch template for each AMI. Then, create a compatible set of instance requirements for each launch template. The minimum and maximum number of vCPUs for an instance type. The minimum number of vCPUs. Max (integer) --- The maximum number of vCPUs. The minimum and maximum instance memory size for an instance type, in MiB. The memory minimum in MiB. Max (integer) --- The memory maximum in MiB. CpuManufacturers (list) --- Lists which specific CPU manufacturers to include. For instance types with Intel CPUs, specify intel. For instance types with AMD CPUs, specify amd. For instance types with Amazon Web Services CPUs, specify amazon-web-services. Default: Any manufacturer (string) --- MemoryGiBPerVCpu (dict) --- The minimum and maximum amount of memory per vCPU for an instance type, in GiB. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (float) --- The memory minimum in GiB. Max (float) --- The memory maximum in GiB. ExcludedInstanceTypes (list) --- The instance types to exclude. You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk ( *), to exclude an instance family, type, size, or generation. The following are examples: m5.8xlarge, c5*.*, m5a.*, r*, *3*. For example, if you specify c5*, you are excluding the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will exclude all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: No excluded instance types (string) --- InstanceGenerations (list) --- Indicates whether current or previous generation instance types are included. For current generation instance types, specify current. The current generation includes EC2 instance types currently recommended for use. This typically includes the latest two to three generations in each instance family. For previous generation instance types, specify previous. Default: Any current or previous generation (string) --- SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice (integer) --- [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified Spot price. The identified Spot price is the price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified price is from either the lowest priced current generation instance types or, failing that, the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects instance types with your attributes, we will exclude instance types whose price exceeds your specified threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling interprets as a percentage. If you set DesiredCapacityType to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is based on the per-vCPU or per-memory price instead of the per instance price. MaxSpotPriceAsPercentageOfOptimalOnDemandPrice (integer) --- [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage of an identified On-Demand price. The identified On-Demand price is the price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes. OnDemandMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice (integer) --- [Price protection] The price protection threshold for On-Demand Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified On-Demand price. To turn off price protection, specify a high value, such as 999999. If you set DesiredCapacityType to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is applied based on the per-vCPU or per-memory price instead of the per instance price. Default: 20 BareMetal (string) --- Indicates whether bare metal instance types are included, excluded, or required. Default: excluded BurstablePerformance (string) --- Indicates whether burstable performance instance types are included, excluded, or required. For more information, see Burstable performance instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. Default: excluded RequireHibernateSupport (boolean) --- Indicates whether instance types must provide On-Demand Instance hibernation support. Default: false NetworkInterfaceCount (dict) --- The minimum and maximum number of network interfaces for an instance type. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (integer) --- The minimum number of network interfaces. Max (integer) --- The maximum number of network interfaces. LocalStorage (string) --- Indicates whether instance types with instance store volumes are included, excluded, or required. For more information, see Amazon EC2 instance store in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. Default: included LocalStorageTypes (list) --- Indicates the type of local storage that is required. For instance types with hard disk drive (HDD) storage, specify hdd. For instance types with solid state drive (SSD) storage, specify ssd. Default: Any local storage type (string) --- TotalLocalStorageGB (dict) --- The minimum and maximum total local storage size for an instance type, in GB. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (float) --- The storage minimum in GB. Max (float) --- The storage maximum in GB. BaselineEbsBandwidthMbps (dict) --- The minimum and maximum baseline bandwidth performance for an instance type, in Mbps. For more information, see Amazon EBS---optimized instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (integer) --- The minimum value in Mbps. Max (integer) --- The maximum value in Mbps. AcceleratorTypes (list) --- Lists the accelerator types that must be on an instance type. For instance types with GPU accelerators, specify gpu. For instance types with FPGA accelerators, specify fpga. For instance types with inference accelerators, specify inference. Default: Any accelerator type (string) --- AcceleratorCount (dict) --- The minimum and maximum number of accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs, or Amazon Web Services Inferentia chips) for an instance type. To exclude accelerator-enabled instance types, set Max to 0. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (integer) --- The minimum value. Max (integer) --- The maximum value. AcceleratorManufacturers (list) --- Indicates whether instance types must have accelerators by specific manufacturers. For instance types with NVIDIA devices, specify nvidia. For instance types with AMD devices, specify amd. For instance types with Amazon Web Services devices, specify amazon-web-services. For instance types with Xilinx devices, specify xilinx. Default: Any manufacturer (string) --- AcceleratorNames (list) --- Lists the accelerators that must be on an instance type. For instance types with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, specify a100. For instance types with NVIDIA V100 GPUs, specify v100. For instance types with NVIDIA K80 GPUs, specify k80. For instance types with NVIDIA T4 GPUs, specify t4. For instance types with NVIDIA M60 GPUs, specify m60. For instance types with AMD Radeon Pro V520 GPUs, specify radeon-pro-v520. For instance types with Xilinx VU9P FPGAs, specify vu9p. Default: Any accelerator (string) --- AcceleratorTotalMemoryMiB (dict) --- The minimum and maximum total memory size for the accelerators on an instance type, in MiB. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (integer) --- The memory minimum in MiB. NetworkBandwidthGbps (dict) --- The minimum and maximum amount of network bandwidth, in gigabits per second (Gbps). Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (float) --- The minimum amount of network bandwidth, in gigabits per second (Gbps). Max (float) --- The maximum amount of network bandwidth, in gigabits per second (Gbps). AllowedInstanceTypes (list) --- The instance types to apply your specified attributes against. All other instance types are ignored, even if they match your specified attributes. You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk ( *), to allow an instance type, size, or generation. For example, if you specify c5*, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will allow the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will allow all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: All instance types (string) --- BaselinePerformanceFactors (dict) --- The baseline performance factors for the instance requirements. Cpu (dict) --- The CPU performance to consider, using an instance family as the baseline reference. References (list) --- Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture differences. (dict) --- Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance types that All instance types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture differences. InstanceFamily (string) --- The instance family to use as a baseline reference. The following instance types are not supported for performance protection. c1 g3| g3s hpc7g m1| m2 mac1 | mac2 | mac2-m1ultra | mac2-m2 | mac2-m2pro p3dn | p4d | p5 t1 u-12tb1 | u-18tb1 | u-24tb1 | u-3tb1 | u-6tb1 | u-9tb1 | u7i-12tb | u7in-16tb | u7in-24tb | u7in-32tb If you performance protection by specifying a supported instance family, the returned instance types will exclude the preceding unsupported instance families. If you specify an unsupported instance family as a value for baseline performance, the API returns an empty response. InstancesDistribution (dict) --- The instances distribution. OnDemandAllocationStrategy (string) --- The allocation strategy to apply to your On-Demand Instances when they are launched. Possible instance types are determined by the launch template overrides that you specify. The following lists the valid values: lowest-price Uses price to determine which instance types are the highest priority, launching the lowest priced instance types within an Availability Zone first. This is the default value for Auto Scaling groups that specify InstanceRequirements. prioritized You set the order of instance types for the launch template overrides from highest to lowest priority (from first to last in the list). Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches your highest priority instance types first. If all your On-Demand capacity cannot be fulfilled using your highest priority instance type, then Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches the remaining capacity using the second priority instance type, and so on. This is the default value for Auto Scaling groups that don't specify InstanceRequirements and cannot be used for groups that do. OnDemandBaseCapacity (integer) --- The minimum amount of the Auto Scaling group's capacity that must be fulfilled by On-Demand Instances. This base portion is launched first as your group scales. This number has the same unit of measurement as the group's desired capacity. If you change the default unit of measurement (number of instances) by specifying weighted capacity values in your launch template overrides list, or by changing the default desired capacity type setting of the group, you must specify this number using the same unit of measurement. Default: 0 OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity (integer) --- Controls the percentages of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances for your additional capacity beyond OnDemandBaseCapacity. Expressed as a number (for example, 20 specifies 20% On-Demand Instances, 80% Spot Instances). If set to 100, only On-Demand Instances are used. Default: 100 SpotAllocationStrategy (string) --- The allocation strategy to apply to your Spot Instances when they are launched. The following lists the valid values: capacity-optimized Requests Spot Instances using pools that are optimally chosen based on the available Spot capacity. This strategy has the lowest risk of interruption. To give certain instance types a higher chance of launching first, use capacity-optimized-prioritized. capacity-optimized-prioritized You set the order of instance types for the launch template overrides from highest to lowest priority (from first to last in the list). Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling honors the instance type priorities on a best effort basis but optimizes for capacity first. Note that if the On-Demand allocation strategy is set to prioritized, the same priority is applied when fulfilling On-Demand capacity. This is not a valid value for Auto Scaling groups that specify InstanceRequirements. lowest-price Requests Spot Instances using the lowest priced pools within an Availability Zone, across the number of Spot pools that you specify for the SpotInstancePools property. To ensure that your desired capacity is met, you might receive Spot Instances from several pools. This is the default value, but it might lead to high interruption rates because this strategy only considers instance price and not available capacity. price-capacity-optimized (recommended) The price and capacity optimized allocation strategy looks at both price and capacity to select the Spot Instance pools that are the least likely to be interrupted and have the lowest possible price. SpotInstancePools (integer) --- The number of Spot Instance pools across which to allocate your Spot Instances. The Spot pools are determined from the different instance types in the overrides. Valid only when the SpotAllocationStrategy is lowest-price. Value must be in the range of 1---20. Default: 2 SpotMaxPrice (string) --- The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance. If your maximum price is lower than the Spot price for the instance types that you selected, your Spot Instances are not launched. We do not recommend specifying a maximum price because it can lead to increased interruptions. When Spot Instances launch, you pay the current Spot price. To remove a maximum price that you previously set, include the property but specify an empty string ('') for the value. Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.001",
