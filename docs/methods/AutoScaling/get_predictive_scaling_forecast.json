  "description": "Retrieves the forecast data for a predictive scaling policy. Load forecasts are predictions of the hourly load values using historical load data from CloudWatch and an analysis of historical trends. Capacity forecasts are represented as predicted values for the minimum capacity that is needed on an hourly basis, based on the hourly load forecast. A minimum of 24 hours of data is required to create the initial forecasts. However, having a full 14 days of historical data results in more accurate forecasts. For more information, see Predictive scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.",
