To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50, specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0. There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy: The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap. At most, one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound. At most, one step adjustment can have a null upper bound.

A time series is a series of data points, each of which is associated with a timestamp. A short name that identifies the object's results in the response. This name must be unique among all TargetTrackingMetricDataQuery objects specified for a single scaling policy. If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression.

Predefined metrics include CPU utilization, network in/out, and the Application Load Balancer request count. For more information, see PredictiveScalingConfiguration in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API Reference. Required if the policy type is PredictiveScaling. This structure includes the metrics and target utilization to use for predictive scaling. This is an array, but we currently only support a single metric specification. That is, you can specify a target value and a single metric pair, or a target value and one scaling metric and one load metric. (dict) --- This structure specifies the metrics and target utilization settings for a predictive scaling policy. You must specify either a metric pair, or a load metric and a scaling metric individually. Specifying a metric pair instead of individual metrics provides a simpler way to configure metrics for a scaling policy. You choose the metric pair, and the policy automatically knows the correct sum and average statistics to use for the load metric and the scaling metric. Example You create a predictive scaling policy and specify ALBRequestCount as the value for the metric pair and 1000.0 as the target value. For this type of metric, you must provide the metric dimension for the corresponding target group, so you also provide a resource label for the Application Load Balancer target group that is attached to your Auto Scaling group. The number of requests the target group receives per minute provides the load metric, and the request count averaged between the members of the target group provides the scaling metric. In CloudWatch, this refers to the RequestCount and RequestCountPerTarget metrics, respectively. For optimal use of predictive scaling, you adhere to the best practice of using a dynamic scaling policy to automatically scale between the minimum capacity and maximum capacity in response to real-time changes in resource utilization. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling consumes data points for the load metric over the last 14 days and creates an hourly load forecast for predictive scaling. (A minimum of 24 hours of data is required.) After creating the load forecast, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling determines when to reduce or increase the capacity of your Auto Scaling group in each hour of the forecast period so that the average number of requests received by each instance is as close to 1000 requests per minute as possible at all times. For information about using custom metrics with predictive scaling, see Advanced predictive scaling policy configurations using custom metrics in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. Specifies the target utilization. PredefinedMetricPairSpecification (dict) --- The predefined metric pair specification from which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling determines the appropriate scaling metric and load metric to use. Indicates which metrics to use. There are two different types of metrics for each metric type: one is a load metric and one is a scaling metric. For example, if the metric type is ASGCPUUtilization, the Auto Scaling group's total CPU metric is used as the load metric, and the average CPU metric is used for the scaling metric. ResourceLabel (string) --- A label that uniquely identifies a specific Application Load Balancer target group from which to determine the total and average request count served by your Auto Scaling group. You can't specify a resource label unless the target group is attached to the Auto Scaling group. You create the resource label by appending the final portion of the load balancer ARN and the final portion of the target group ARN into a single value, separated by a forward slash (/). The format of the resource label is: app/my-alb/778d41231b141a0f/targetgroup/my-alb-target-group/943f017f100becff. Where: app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id> is the final portion of the load balancer ARN targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<target-group-id> is the final portion of the target group ARN.

For example, the forecast says to add capacity at 10:00 AM, and you choose to pre-launch instances by 5 minutes. In that case, the instances will be launched at 9:55 AM. The intention is to give resources time to be provisioned. It can take a few minutes to launch an EC2 instance. The actual amount of time required depends on several factors, such as the size of the instance and whether there are startup scripts to complete. The value must be less than the forecast interval duration of 3600 seconds (60 minutes). Defaults to 300 seconds if not specified. MaxCapacityBreachBehavior (string) --- Defines the behavior that should be applied if the forecast capacity approaches or exceeds the maximum capacity of the Auto Scaling group.

IncreaseMaxCapacity - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can increase the maximum capacity of the group when the forecast capacity is close to or exceeds the maximum capacity. The upper limit is determined by the forecasted capacity and the value for MaxCapacityBuffer. MaxCapacityBuffer (integer) --- The size of the capacity buffer to use when the forecast capacity is close to or exceeds the maximum capacity. The value is specified as a percentage relative to the forecast capacity. For example, if the buffer is 10, this means a 10 percent buffer, such that if the forecast capacity is 50, and the maximum capacity is 40, then the effective maximum capacity is 55. If set to 0, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling may scale capacity higher than the maximum capacity to equal but not exceed forecast capacity.
