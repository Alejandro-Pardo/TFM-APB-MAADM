  "description": "Gets information about the load balancers for the specified Auto Scaling group. This operation describes only Classic Load Balancers. If you have Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, or Gateway Load Balancers, use the DescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups API instead. To determine the attachment status of the load balancer, use the State element in the response. When you attach a load balancer to an Auto Scaling group, the initial State value is Adding. The state transitions to Added after all Auto Scaling instances are registered with the load balancer. If Elastic Load Balancing health checks are enabled for the Auto Scaling group, the state transitions to InService after at least one Auto Scaling instance passes the health check. When the load balancer is in the InService state, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can terminate and replace any instances that are reported as unhealthy. If no registered instances pass the health checks, the load balancer doesn't enter the InService state. Load balancers also have an InService state if you attach them in the CreateAutoScalingGroup API call. If your load balancer state is InService, but it is not working properly, check the scaling activities by calling DescribeScalingActivities and take any corrective actions necessary. For help with failed health checks, see Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: Health checks in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. For more information, see Use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across the instances in your Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.",
