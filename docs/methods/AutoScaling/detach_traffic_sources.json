To get the ARN of a target group for VPC Lattice, use the VPC Lattice GetTargetGroup API operation. Type (string) --- Provides additional context for the value of Identifier. The following lists the valid values: elb if Identifier is the name of a Classic Load Balancer. elbv2 if Identifier is the ARN of an Application Load Balancer, Gateway Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer target group. vpc-lattice if Identifier is the ARN of a VPC Lattice target group.
