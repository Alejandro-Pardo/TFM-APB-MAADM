  "description": "Describes the specified tags. You can use filters to limit the results. For example, you can query for the tags for a specific Auto Scaling group. You can specify multiple values for a filter. A tag must match at least one of the specified values for it to be included in the results. You can also specify multiple filters. The result includes information for a particular tag only if it matches all the filters. If there's no match, no special message is returned. For more information, see Tag Auto Scaling groups and instances in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.",

(dict) --- Describes a filter that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. If you specify multiple filters, the filters are automatically logically joined with an AND, and the request returns only the results that match all of the specified filters. For more information, see Tag Auto Scaling groups and instances in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. Name (string) --- The name of the filter. The valid values for Name depend on which API operation you're using with the filter ( DescribeAutoScalingGroups or DescribeTags). Valid values for Name include the following: tag-key - Accepts tag keys. The results only include information about the Auto Scaling groups associated with these tag keys. tag-value - Accepts tag values. The results only include information about the Auto Scaling groups associated with these tag values. tag:<key> - Accepts the key/value combination of the tag. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. The results only include information about the Auto Scaling groups associated with the specified key/value combination. Valid values for Name include the following: auto-scaling-group - Accepts the names of Auto Scaling groups. The results only include information about the tags associated with these Auto Scaling groups. key - Accepts tag keys. The results only include information about the tags associated with these tag keys. value - Accepts tag values. The results only include information about the tags associated with these tag values. propagate-at-launch - Accepts a Boolean value, which specifies whether tags propagate to instances at launch. The results only include information about the tags associated with the specified Boolean value. Values (list) --- One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are automatically logically joined with an OR, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values. For example, specify 'tag:environment' for the filter name and 'production,development' for the filter values to find Auto Scaling groups with the tag 'environment=production' or 'environment=development'.
