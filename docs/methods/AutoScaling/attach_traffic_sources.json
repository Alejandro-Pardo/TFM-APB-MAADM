You can use any of the following as traffic sources for an Auto Scaling group: This operation is additive and does not detach existing traffic sources from the Auto Scaling group. After the operation completes, use the DescribeTrafficSources API to return details about the state of the attachments between traffic sources and your Auto Scaling group. To detach a traffic source from the Auto Scaling group, call the DetachTrafficSources API.",

To get the ARN of a target group for VPC Lattice, use the VPC Lattice GetTargetGroup API operation. Type (string) --- Provides additional context for the value of Identifier. The following lists the valid values: elb if Identifier is the name of a Classic Load Balancer. elbv2 if Identifier is the ARN of an Application Load Balancer, Gateway Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer target group. vpc-lattice if Identifier is the ARN of a VPC Lattice target group.
