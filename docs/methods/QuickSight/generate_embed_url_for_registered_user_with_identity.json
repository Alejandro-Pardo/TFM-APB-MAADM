  "description": "Generates an embed URL that you can use to embed an Amazon QuickSight experience in your website. This action can be used for any type of user that is registered in an Amazon QuickSight account that uses IAM Identity Center for authentication. This API requires identity-enhanced IAM Role sessions for the authenticated user that the API call is being made for. This API uses trusted identity propagation to ensure that an end user is authenticated and receives the embed URL that is specific to that user. The IAM Identity Center application that the user has logged into needs to have trusted Identity Propagation enabled for Amazon QuickSight with the scope value set to quicksight:read. Before you use this action, make sure that you have configured the relevant Amazon QuickSight resource and permissions.",
