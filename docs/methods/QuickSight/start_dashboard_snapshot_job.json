  "description": "Starts an asynchronous job that generates a snapshot of a dashboard's output. You can request one or several of the following format configurations in each API call. The status of a submitted job can be polled with the DescribeDashboardSnapshotJob API. When you call the DescribeDashboardSnapshotJob API, check the JobStatus field in the response. Once the job reaches a COMPLETED or FAILED status, use the DescribeDashboardSnapshotJobResult API to obtain the URLs for the generated files. If the job fails, the DescribeDashboardSnapshotJobResult API returns detailed information about the error that occurred. Amazon QuickSight utilizes API throttling to create a more consistent user experience within a time span for customers when they call the StartDashboardSnapshotJob. By default, 12 jobs can run simlutaneously in one Amazon Web Services account and users can submit up 10 API requests per second before an account is throttled. If an overwhelming number of API requests are made by the same user in a short period of time, Amazon QuickSight throttles the API calls to maintin an optimal experience and reliability for all Amazon QuickSight users. The following list provides information about the most commin throttling scenarios that can occur. If your use case requires a higher throttling limit, contact your account admin or Amazon Web ServicesSupport to explore options to tailor a more optimal expereince for your account. If your use case projects high levels of API traffic, try to reduce the degree of frequency and parallelism of API calls as much as you can to avoid throttling. You can also perform a timing test to calculate an estimate for the total processing time of your projected load that stays within the throttling limits of the Amazon QuickSight APIs. For example, if your projected traffic is 100 snapshot jobs before 12:00 PM per day, start 12 jobs in parallel and measure the amount of time it takes to proccess all 12 jobs. Once you obtain the result, multiply the duration by 9, for example (12 minutes * 9 = 108 minutes). Use the new result to determine the latest time at which the jobs need to be started to meet your target deadline. The time that it takes to process a job can be impacted by the following factors:",
