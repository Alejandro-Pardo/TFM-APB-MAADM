The comparison operator that you want to use as a filter, for example \"Operator\": \"StringEquals\". Valid values are \"StringEquals\" and \"StringLike\". If you set the operator value to \"StringEquals\", you need to provide an ownership related filter in the \"NAME\" field and the arn of the user or group whose data sources you want to search in the \"Value\" field. For example, \"Name\":\"DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_OWNER\", \"Operator\": \"StringEquals\", \"Value\": \"arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:1:user/default/UserName1\". If you set the value to \"StringLike\", you need to provide the name of the data sources you are searching for. For example, \"Name\":\"DATASOURCE_NAME\", \"Operator\": \"StringLike\", \"Value\": \"Test\". The \"StringLike\" operator only supports the NAME value DATASOURCE_NAME. The name of the value that you want to use as a filter, for example, \"Name\": \"DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_OWNER\". Valid values are defined as follows: DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_VIEWER_OR_OWNER: Provide an ARN of a user or group, and any data sources with that ARN listed as one of the owners or viewers of the data sources are returned. Implicit permissions from folders or groups are not considered. DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_OWNER: Provide an ARN of a user or group, and any data sources with that ARN listed as one of the owners if the data source are returned. DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_SOLE_OWNER: Provide an ARN of a user or group, and any data sources with that ARN listed as the only owner of the data source are returned. DATASOURCE_NAME: Any data sources whose names have a substring match to the provided value are returned. The value of the named item, for example DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_OWNER, that you want to use as a filter, for example, \"Value\": \"arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:1:user/default/UserName1\".",
