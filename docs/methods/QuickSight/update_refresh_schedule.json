MINUTE30:The dataset refreshes every 30 minutes. HOURLY: The dataset refreshes every hour. DAILY: The dataset refreshes every day. WEEKLY: The dataset refreshes every week. MONTHLY: The dataset refreshes every month. RefreshOnDay (dict) --- The day of the week that you want to schedule the refresh on. This value is required for weekly and monthly refresh intervals. DayOfWeek (string) --- The day of the week that you want to schedule a refresh on. DayOfMonth (string) --- The day of the month that you want to schedule refresh on. Timezone (string) --- The timezone that you want the refresh schedule to use. The timezone ID must match a corresponding ID found on java.util.time.getAvailableIDs(). TimeOfTheDay (string) --- The time of day that you want the datset to refresh. This value is expressed in HH:MM format. This field is not required for schedules that refresh hourly. StartAfterDateTime (datetime) --- Time after which the refresh schedule can be started, expressed in YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS format. The type of refresh that a datset undergoes. Valid values are as follows: FULL_REFRESH: A complete refresh of a dataset. INCREMENTAL_REFRESH: A partial refresh of some rows of a dataset, based on the time window specified.
