Certificates must be in the ACTIVE state to authenticate devices that use a certificate to connect to IoT. Within a few minutes of updating a certificate from the ACTIVE state to any other state, IoT disconnects all devices that used that certificate to connect. Devices cannot use a certificate that is not in the ACTIVE state to reconnect.",
