  "description": "Gets a list of aliases (also called CNAMEs or alternate domain names) that conflict or overlap with the provided alias, and the associated CloudFront distributions and Amazon Web Services accounts for each conflicting alias. In the returned list, the distribution and account IDs are partially hidden, which allows you to identify the distributions and accounts that you own, but helps to protect the information of ones that you don't own. Use this operation to find aliases that are in use in CloudFront that conflict or overlap with the provided alias. For example, if you provide www.example.com as input, the returned list can include www.example.com and the overlapping wildcard alternate domain name ( *.example.com), if they exist. If you provide *.example.com as input, the returned list can include *.example.com and any alternate domain names covered by that wildcard (for example, www.example.com, test.example.com, dev.example.com, and so on), if they exist. To list conflicting aliases, you provide the alias to search and the ID of a distribution in your account that has an attached SSL/TLS certificate that includes the provided alias. For more information, including how to set up the distribution and certificate, see Moving an alternate domain name to a different distribution in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker value in the subsequent request.",
