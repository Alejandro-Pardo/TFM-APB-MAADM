  "description": "Creates a continuous deployment policy that distributes traffic for a custom domain name to two different CloudFront distributions. To use a continuous deployment policy, first use CopyDistribution to create a staging distribution, then use UpdateDistribution to modify the staging distribution's configuration. After you create and update a staging distribution, you can use a continuous deployment policy to incrementally move traffic to the staging distribution. This workflow enables you to test changes to a distribution's configuration before moving all of your domain's production traffic to the new configuration.",
