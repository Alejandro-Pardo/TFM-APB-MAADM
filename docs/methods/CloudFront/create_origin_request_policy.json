  "description": "Creates an origin request policy. After you create an origin request policy, you can attach it to one or more cache behaviors. When it's attached to a cache behavior, the origin request policy determines the values that CloudFront includes in requests that it sends to the origin. Each request that CloudFront sends to the origin includes the following: CloudFront sends a request when it can't find a valid object in its cache that matches the request. If you want to send values to the origin and also include them in the cache key, use CachePolicy. For more information about origin request policies, see Controlling origin requests in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.",
