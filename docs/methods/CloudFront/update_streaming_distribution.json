If the value of CallerReference is new (regardless of the content of the StreamingDistributionConfig object), CloudFront creates a new distribution. If CallerReference is a value that you already sent in a previous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a DistributionAlreadyExists error. A complex type that contains information about the Amazon S3 bucket from which you want CloudFront to get your media files for distribution. The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin. The CloudFront origin access identity to associate with the distribution. Use an origin access identity to configure the distribution so that end users can only access objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront. If you want end users to be able to access objects using either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty OriginAccessIdentity element. To delete the origin access identity from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty OriginAccessIdentity element. To replace the origin access identity, update the distribution configuration and specify the new origin access identity. For more information, see Using an Origin Access Identity to Restrict Access to Your Amazon S3 Content in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. Aliases (dict) --- A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate domain names), if any, for this streaming distribution.

(string) --- Any comments you want to include about the streaming distribution. Logging (dict) --- A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the streaming distribution. Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when you create a streaming distribution or if you want to disable logging for an existing streaming distribution, specify false for Enabled, and specify empty Bucket and Prefix elements. If you specify false for Enabled but you specify values for Bucket and Prefix, the values are automatically deleted. The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for example, amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com. An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log filenames for this streaming distribution, for example, myprefix/. If you want to enable logging, but you don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an empty Prefix element in the Logging element. A complex type that specifies any Amazon Web Services accounts that you want to permit to create signed URLs for private content. If you want the distribution to use signed URLs, include this element; if you want the distribution to use public URLs, remove this element. For more information, see Serving Private Content through CloudFront in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.
