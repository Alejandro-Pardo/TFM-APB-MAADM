  "description": "Returns the refresh status of the Trusted Advisor checks that have the specified check IDs. You can get the check IDs by calling the  DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks operation. Some checks are refreshed automatically, and you can't return their refresh statuses by using the DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses operation. If you call this operation for these checks, you might see an InvalidParameterValue error. To call the Trusted Advisor operations in the Amazon Web Services Support API, you must use the US East (N. Virginia) endpoint. Currently, the US West (Oregon) and Europe (Ireland) endpoints don't support the Trusted Advisor operations. For more information, see About the Amazon Web Services Support API in the Amazon Web Services Support User Guide.",
