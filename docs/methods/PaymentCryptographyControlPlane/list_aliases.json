  "description": "Lists the aliases for all keys in the caller's Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region. You can filter the aliases by keyARN. For more information, see Using aliases in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. This is a paginated operation, which means that each response might contain only a subset of all the aliases. When the response contains only a subset of aliases, it includes a NextToken value. Use this value in a subsequent ListAliases request to get more aliases. When you receive a response with no NextToken (or an empty or null value), that means there are no more aliases to get. Cross-account use: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.",
