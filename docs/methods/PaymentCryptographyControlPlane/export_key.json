  "description": "Exports a key from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography simplifies key exchange by replacing the existing paper-based approach with a modern electronic approach. With ExportKey you can export symmetric keys using either symmetric and asymmetric key exchange mechanisms. Using this operation, you can share your Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography generated keys with other service partners to perform cryptographic operations outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. For symmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses the ANSI X9 TR-31 norm in accordance with PCI PIN guidelines. And for asymmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports ANSI X9 TR-34 norm, RSA unwrap, and ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) key exchange mechanisms. Asymmetric key exchange methods are typically used to establish bi-directional trust between the two parties exhanging keys and are used for initial key exchange such as Key Encryption Key (KEK). After which you can export working keys using symmetric method to perform various cryptographic operations within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. PCI requires specific minimum key strength of wrapping keys used to protect the keys being exchanged electronically. These requirements can change when PCI standards are revised. The rules specify that wrapping keys used for transport must be at least as strong as the key being protected. For more information on recommended key strength of wrapping keys and key exchange mechanism, see Importing and exporting keys in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. You can also use ExportKey functionality to generate and export an IPEK (Initial Pin Encryption Key) from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography using either TR-31 or TR-34 export key exchange. IPEK is generated from BDK (Base Derivation Key) and ExportDukptInitialKey attribute KSN ( KeySerialNumber). The generated IPEK does not persist within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography and has to be re-generated each time during export. For key exchange using TR-31 or TR-34 key blocks, you can also export optional blocks within the key block header which contain additional attribute information about the key. The KeyVersion within KeyBlockHeaders indicates the version of the key within the key block. Furthermore, KeyExportability within KeyBlockHeaders can be used to further restrict exportability of the key after export from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. The OptionalBlocks contain the additional data related to the key. For information on data type that can be included within optional blocks, refer to ASC X9.143-2022. Using this operation, you can export initial key using TR-34 asymmetric key exchange. You can only export KEK generated within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. In TR-34 terminology, the sending party of the key is called Key Distribution Host (KDH) and the receiving party of the key is called Key Receiving Device (KRD). During key export process, KDH is Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography which initiates key export and KRD is the user receiving the key. To initiate TR-34 key export, the KRD must obtain an export token by calling GetParametersForExport. This operation also generates a key pair for the purpose of key export, signs the key and returns back the signing public key certificate (also known as KDH signing certificate) and root certificate chain. The KDH uses the private key to sign the the export payload and the signing public key certificate is provided to KRD to verify the signature. The KRD can import the root certificate into its Hardware Security Module (HSM), as required. The export token and the associated KDH signing certificate expires after 30 days. Next the KRD generates a key pair for the the purpose of encrypting the KDH key and provides the public key cerificate (also known as KRD wrapping certificate) back to KDH. The KRD will also import the root cerificate chain into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling ImportKey for RootCertificatePublicKey. The KDH, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, will use the KRD wrapping cerificate to encrypt (wrap) the key under export and signs it with signing private key to generate a TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock. For more information on TR-34 key export, see section Exporting symmetric keys in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. Set the following parameters: When this operation is successful, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography returns the KEK or IPEK as a TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock. Using this operation, you can export initial key using asymmetric RSA wrap and unwrap key exchange method. To initiate export, generate an asymmetric key pair on the receiving HSM and obtain the public key certificate in PEM format (base64 encoded) for the purpose of wrapping and the root certifiate chain. Import the root certificate into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling ImportKey for RootCertificatePublicKey. Next call ExportKey and set the following parameters: When this operation is successful, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography returns the WrappedKeyCryptogram. Using this operation, you can export working keys or IPEK using TR-31 symmetric key exchange. In TR-31, you must use an initial key such as KEK to encrypt or wrap the key under export. To establish a KEK, you can use CreateKey or ImportKey. Set the following parameters: You can also use ECDH key agreement to export working keys in a TR-31 keyblock, where the wrapping key is an ECDH derived key. To initiate a TR-31 key export using ECDH, both sides must create an ECC key pair with key usage K3 and exchange public key certificates. In Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, you can do this by calling CreateKey. If you have not already done so, you must import the CA chain that issued the receiving public key certificate by calling ImportKey with input RootCertificatePublicKey for root CA or TrustedPublicKey for intermediate CA. You can then complete a TR-31 key export by deriving a shared wrapping key using the service ECC key pair, public certificate of your ECC key pair outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, and the key derivation parameters including key derivation function, hash algorithm, derivation data, key algorithm. When this operation is successful, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography returns the working key as a TR-31 WrappedKeyBlock, where the wrapping key is the ECDH derived key. Cross-account use: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.",
