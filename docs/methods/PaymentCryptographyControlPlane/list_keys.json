  "description": "Lists the keys in the caller's Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region. You can filter the list of keys. This is a paginated operation, which means that each response might contain only a subset of all the keys. When the response contains only a subset of keys, it includes a NextToken value. Use this value in a subsequent ListKeys request to get more keys. When you receive a response with no NextToken (or an empty or null value), that means there are no more keys to get. Cross-account use: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.",
