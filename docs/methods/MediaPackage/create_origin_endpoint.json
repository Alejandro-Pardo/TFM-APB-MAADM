      "description": "A Common Media Application Format (CMAF) packaging configuration. Encryption (dict) --- A Common Media Application Format (CMAF) encryption configuration. ConstantInitializationVector (string) --- An optional 128-bit, 16-byte hex value represented by a 32-character string, used in conjunction with the key for encrypting blocks. If you don't specify a value, then MediaPackage creates the constant initialization vector (IV). EncryptionMethod (string) --- The encryption method to use. KeyRotationIntervalSeconds (integer) --- Time (in seconds) between each encryption key rotation. CertificateArn (string) --- An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Certificate Manager certificate that MediaPackage will use for enforcing secure end-to-end data transfer with the key provider service. EncryptionContractConfiguration (dict) --- Use encryptionContractConfiguration to configure one or more content encryption keys for your endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. The encryption contract defines which content keys are used to encrypt the audio and video tracks in your stream. To configure the encryption contract, specify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note the following considerations when using encryptionContractConfiguration: encryptionContractConfiguration can be used for DASH or CMAF endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You must disable key rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRotationIntervalSeconds to 0. (string) --- HlsManifests (list) --- A list of HLS manifest configurations (dict) --- A HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration. AdMarkers (string) --- This setting controls how ad markers are included in the packaged OriginEndpoint. 'NONE' will omit all SCTE-35 ad markers from the output. 'PASSTHROUGH' causes the manifest to contain a copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (comments) taken directly from the input HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest. 'SCTE35_ENHANCED' generates ad markers and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the input source. 'DATERANGE' inserts EXT-X-DATERANGE tags to signal ad and program transition events in HLS and CMAF manifests. For this option, you must set a programDateTimeIntervalSeconds value that is greater than 0. AdTriggers (list) --- A list of SCTE-35 message types that are treated as ad markers in the output. If empty, no ad markers are output. Specify multiple items to create ad markers for all of the included message types. (string) --- AdsOnDeliveryRestrictions (string) --- This setting allows the delivery restriction flags on SCTE-35 segmentation descriptors to determine whether a message signals an ad. Choosing 'NONE' means no SCTE-35 messages become ads. Choosing 'RESTRICTED' means SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in AdTriggers that contain delivery restrictions will be treated as ads. Choosing 'UNRESTRICTED' means SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in AdTriggers that do not contain delivery restrictions will be treated as ads. Choosing 'BOTH' means all SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in AdTriggers will be treated as ads. Note that Splice Insert messages do not have these flags and are always treated as ads if specified in AdTriggers. IncludeIframeOnlyStream (boolean) --- When enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included in the output. ManifestName (string) --- An optional short string appended to the end of the OriginEndpoint URL. If not specified, defaults to the manifestName for the OriginEndpoint. PlaylistType (string) --- The HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlist type. When either 'EVENT' or 'VOD' is specified, a corresponding EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE entry will be included in the media playlist. PlaylistWindowSeconds (integer) --- Time window (in seconds) contained in each parent manifest. ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds (integer) --- The interval (in seconds) between each EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally, when an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated every 5 seconds using the ingest time of the content. If the interval is not specified, or set to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be inserted into manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parameter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata is found in HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed through to HLS output. SegmentDurationSeconds (integer) --- Duration (in seconds) of each segment. Actual segments will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the source segment duration. SegmentPrefix (string) --- An optional custom string that is prepended to the name of each segment. If not specified, it defaults to the ChannelId. StreamSelection (dict) --- A StreamSelection configuration. MaxVideoBitsPerSecond (integer) --- The maximum video bitrate (bps) to include in output. MinVideoBitsPerSecond (integer) --- The minimum video bitrate (bps) to include in output. StreamOrder (string) --- A directive that determines the order of streams in the output.",

      "description": "An HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) packaging configuration. AdMarkers (string) --- This setting controls how ad markers are included in the packaged OriginEndpoint. 'NONE' will omit all SCTE-35 ad markers from the output. 'PASSTHROUGH' causes the manifest to contain a copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (comments) taken directly from the input HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest. 'SCTE35_ENHANCED' generates ad markers and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the input source. 'DATERANGE' inserts EXT-X-DATERANGE tags to signal ad and program transition events in HLS and CMAF manifests. For this option, you must set a programDateTimeIntervalSeconds value that is greater than 0. AdTriggers (list) --- A list of SCTE-35 message types that are treated as ad markers in the output. If empty, no ad markers are output. Specify multiple items to create ad markers for all of the included message types. (string) --- AdsOnDeliveryRestrictions (string) --- This setting allows the delivery restriction flags on SCTE-35 segmentation descriptors to determine whether a message signals an ad. Choosing 'NONE' means no SCTE-35 messages become ads. Choosing 'RESTRICTED' means SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in AdTriggers that contain delivery restrictions will be treated as ads. Choosing 'UNRESTRICTED' means SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in AdTriggers that do not contain delivery restrictions will be treated as ads. Choosing 'BOTH' means all SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in AdTriggers will be treated as ads. Note that Splice Insert messages do not have these flags and are always treated as ads if specified in AdTriggers. Encryption (dict) --- An HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) encryption configuration. ConstantInitializationVector (string) --- A constant initialization vector for encryption (optional). When not specified the initialization vector will be periodically rotated. EncryptionMethod (string) --- The encryption method to use. KeyRotationIntervalSeconds (integer) --- Interval (in seconds) between each encryption key rotation. RepeatExtXKey (boolean) --- When enabled, the EXT-X-KEY tag will be repeated in output manifests. CertificateArn (string) --- An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Certificate Manager certificate that MediaPackage will use for enforcing secure end-to-end data transfer with the key provider service. EncryptionContractConfiguration (dict) --- Use encryptionContractConfiguration to configure one or more content encryption keys for your endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. The encryption contract defines which content keys are used to encrypt the audio and video tracks in your stream. To configure the encryption contract, specify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note the following considerations when using encryptionContractConfiguration: encryptionContractConfiguration can be used for DASH or CMAF endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You must disable key rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRotationIntervalSeconds to 0. (string) --- IncludeDvbSubtitles (boolean) --- When enabled, MediaPackage passes through digital video broadcasting (DVB) subtitles into the output. IncludeIframeOnlyStream (boolean) --- When enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included in the output. PlaylistType (string) --- The HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlist type. When either 'EVENT' or 'VOD' is specified, a corresponding EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE entry will be included in the media playlist. PlaylistWindowSeconds (integer) --- Time window (in seconds) contained in each parent manifest. ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds (integer) --- The interval (in seconds) between each EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally, when an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated every 5 seconds using the ingest time of the content. If the interval is not specified, or set to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be inserted into manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parameter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata is found in HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed through to HLS output. SegmentDurationSeconds (integer) --- Duration (in seconds) of each fragment. Actual fragments will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the source fragment duration. StreamSelection (dict) --- A StreamSelection configuration. MaxVideoBitsPerSecond (integer) --- The maximum video bitrate (bps) to include in output. MinVideoBitsPerSecond (integer) --- The minimum video bitrate (bps) to include in output. StreamOrder (string) --- A directive that determines the order of streams in the output. UseAudioRenditionGroup (boolean) --- When enabled, audio streams will be placed in rendition groups in the output.",
