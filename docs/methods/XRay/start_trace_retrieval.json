  "description": "Initiates a trace retrieval process using the specified time range and for the give trace IDs on Transaction Search generated by the CloudWatch log group. For more information, see Transaction Search. API returns a RetrievalToken, which can be used with ListRetrievedTraces or GetRetrievedTracesGraph to fetch results. Retrievals will time out after 60 minutes. To execute long time ranges, consider segmenting into multiple retrievals. If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account to retrieve data from a linked source account, as long as both accounts have transaction search enabled. For retrieving data from X-Ray directly as opposed to the Transaction-Search Log group, see BatchGetTraces.",
