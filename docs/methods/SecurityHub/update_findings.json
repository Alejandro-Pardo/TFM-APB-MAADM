  "description": "UpdateFindings is a deprecated operation. Instead of UpdateFindings, use the BatchUpdateFindings operation. The UpdateFindings operation updates the Note and RecordState of the Security Hub aggregated findings that the filter attributes specify. Any member account that can view the finding can also see the update to the finding. Finding updates made with UpdateFindings aren't persisted if the same finding is later updated by the finding provider through the BatchImportFindings operation. In addition, Security Hub doesn't record updates made with UpdateFindings in the finding history.",
