  "description": "Imports security findings generated by a finding provider into Security Hub. This action is requested by the finding provider to import its findings into Security Hub. BatchImportFindings must be called by one of the following: The maximum allowed size for a finding is 240 Kb. An error is returned for any finding larger than 240 Kb. After a finding is created, BatchImportFindings cannot be used to update the following finding fields and objects, which Security Hub customers use to manage their investigation workflow. Finding providers also should not use BatchImportFindings to update the following attributes. Instead, finding providers use FindingProviderFields to provide values for these attributes.",
