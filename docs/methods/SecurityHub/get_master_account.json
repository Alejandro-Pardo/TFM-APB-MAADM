It will eventually change to use GetAdministratorAccount. Any IAM policies that specifically control access to this function must continue to use GetMasterAccount. You should also add GetAdministratorAccount to your policies to ensure that the correct permissions are in place after the console begins to use GetAdministratorAccount. Provides the details for the Security Hub administrator account for the current member account. Can be used by both member accounts that are managed using Organizations and accounts that were invited manually.",
