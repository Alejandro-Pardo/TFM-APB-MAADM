  "description": "This method is deprecated. Instead, use AcceptAdministratorInvitation. The Security Hub console continues to use AcceptInvitation. It will eventually change to use AcceptAdministratorInvitation. Any IAM policies that specifically control access to this function must continue to use AcceptInvitation. You should also add AcceptAdministratorInvitation to your policies to ensure that the correct permissions are in place after the console begins to use AcceptAdministratorInvitation. Accepts the invitation to be a member account and be monitored by the Security Hub administrator account that the invitation was sent from. This operation is only used by member accounts that are not added through Organizations. When the member account accepts the invitation, permission is granted to the administrator account to view findings generated in the member account.",
