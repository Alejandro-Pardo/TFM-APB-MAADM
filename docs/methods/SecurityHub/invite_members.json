This operation is only used to invite accounts that don't belong to an Amazon Web Services organization. Organization accounts don't receive invitations. Before you can use this action to invite a member, you must first use the CreateMembers action to create the member account in Security Hub. When the account owner enables Security Hub and accepts the invitation to become a member account, the administrator account can view the findings generated in the member account.",
