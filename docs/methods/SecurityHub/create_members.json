  "description": "Creates a member association in Security Hub between the specified accounts and the account used to make the request, which is the administrator account. If you are integrated with Organizations, then the administrator account is designated by the organization management account. CreateMembers is always used to add accounts that are not organization members. For accounts that are managed using Organizations, CreateMembers is only used in the following cases: This action can only be used by an account that has Security Hub enabled. To enable Security Hub, you can use the EnableSecurityHub operation. For accounts that are not organization members, you create the account association and then send an invitation to the member account. To send the invitation, you use the InviteMembers operation. If the account owner accepts the invitation, the account becomes a member account in Security Hub. Accounts that are managed using Organizations don't receive an invitation. They automatically become a member account in Security Hub. A permissions policy is added that permits the administrator account to view the findings generated in the member account. To remove the association between the administrator and member accounts, use the DisassociateFromMasterAccount or DisassociateMembers operation.",
