  "description": "Use this operation to create a workforce. This operation will return an error if a workforce already exists in the Amazon Web Services Region that you specify. You can only create one workforce in each Amazon Web Services Region per Amazon Web Services account. If you want to create a new workforce in an Amazon Web Services Region where a workforce already exists, use the DeleteWorkforce API operation to delete the existing workforce and then use CreateWorkforce to create a new workforce. To create a private workforce using Amazon Cognito, you must specify a Cognito user pool in CognitoConfig. You can also create an Amazon Cognito workforce using the Amazon SageMaker console. For more information, see Create a Private Workforce (Amazon Cognito). To create a private workforce using your own OIDC Identity Provider (IdP), specify your IdP configuration in OidcConfig. Your OIDC IdP must support groups because groups are used by Ground Truth and Amazon A2I to create work teams. For more information, see Create a Private Workforce (OIDC IdP).",
