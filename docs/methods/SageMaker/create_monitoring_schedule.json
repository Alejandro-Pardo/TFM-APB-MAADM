A cron expression that describes details about the monitoring schedule. The supported cron expressions are: If you want to set the job to start every hour, use the following: Hourly: cron(0 * ? * * *) If you want to start the job daily: cron(0 [00-23] ? * * *) If you want to run the job one time, immediately, use the following keyword: NOW For example, the following are valid cron expressions: Daily at noon UTC: cron(0 12 ? * * *) Daily at midnight UTC: cron(0 0 ? * * *) To support running every 6, 12 hours, the following are also supported: cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *) For example, the following are valid cron expressions: Every 12 hours, starting at 5pm UTC: cron(0 17/12 ? * * *) Every two hours starting at midnight: cron(0 0/2 ? * * *) You can also specify the keyword NOW to run the monitoring job immediately, one time, without recurring. DataAnalysisStartTime (string) --- Sets the start time for a monitoring job window. Express this time as an offset to the times that you schedule your monitoring jobs to run. You schedule monitoring jobs with the ScheduleExpression parameter. Specify this offset in ISO 8601 duration format. For example, if you want to monitor the five hours of data in your dataset that precede the start of each monitoring job, you would specify: \"-PT5H\". The start time that you specify must not precede the end time that you specify by more than 24 hours. You specify the end time with the DataAnalysisEndTime parameter. If you set ScheduleExpression to NOW, this parameter is required. DataAnalysisEndTime (string) --- Sets the end time for a monitoring job window. For example, if you want to end the window one hour before the start of each monitoring job, you would specify: \"-PT1H\".

The Amazon S3 storage location where the results of a monitoring job are saved. A URI that identifies the Amazon S3 storage location where Amazon SageMaker AI saves the results of a monitoring job. The local path to the Amazon S3 storage location where Amazon SageMaker AI saves the results of a monitoring job. LocalPath is an absolute path for the output data. S3UploadMode (string) --- Whether to upload the results of the monitoring job continuously or after the job completes. KmsKeyId (string) --- The Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker AI uses to encrypt the model artifacts at rest using Amazon S3 server-side encryption.
