  "description": "Creates an Autopilot job also referred to as Autopilot experiment or AutoML job V2. An AutoML job in SageMaker AI is a fully automated process that allows you to build machine learning models with minimal effort and machine learning expertise. When initiating an AutoML job, you provide your data and optionally specify parameters tailored to your use case. SageMaker AI then automates the entire model development lifecycle, including data preprocessing, model training, tuning, and evaluation. AutoML jobs are designed to simplify and accelerate the model building process by automating various tasks and exploring different combinations of machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter values. The output of an AutoML job comprises one or more trained models ready for deployment and inference. Additionally, SageMaker AI AutoML jobs generate a candidate model leaderboard, allowing you to select the best-performing model for deployment. For more information about AutoML jobs, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-automate-model-development.html in the SageMaker AI developer guide. AutoML jobs V2 support various problem types such as regression, binary, and multiclass classification with tabular data, text and image classification, time-series forecasting, and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) for text generation. For the list of available problem types supported by CreateAutoMLJobV2, see AutoMLProblemTypeConfig. You can find the best-performing model after you run an AutoML job V2 by calling DescribeAutoMLJobV2.",

For tabular and time-series data, you can customize the algorithm list by selecting a subset of algorithms for your problem type. AlgorithmsConfig stores the customized selection of algorithms to train on your data. For the tabular problem type TabularJobConfig, the list of available algorithms to choose from depends on the training mode set in AutoMLJobConfig.Mode. AlgorithmsConfig should not be set when the training mode AutoMLJobConfig.Mode is set to AUTO. When AlgorithmsConfig is provided, one AutoMLAlgorithms attribute must be set and one only. If the list of algorithms provided as values for AutoMLAlgorithms is empty, CandidateGenerationConfig uses the full set of algorithms for the given training mode.

FeatureSpecificationS3Uri (string) --- A URL to the Amazon S3 data source containing selected features from the input data source to run an Autopilot job V2. } } In ensembling mode, Autopilot only supports the following data types: numeric, categorical, text, and datetime. In HPO mode, Autopilot can support numeric, categorical, text, datetime, and sequence. If only FeatureDataTypes is provided, the column keys ( col1, col2,..) should be a subset of the column names in the input data. If both FeatureDataTypes and FeatureAttributeNames are provided, then the column keys should be a subset of the column names provided in FeatureAttributeNames. The key name FeatureAttributeNames is fixed. The values listed in [\"col1\", \"col2\", ...] are case sensitive and should be a list of strings containing unique values that are a subset of the column names in the input data. The list of columns provided must not include the target column. Mode (string) --- The method that Autopilot uses to train the data. You can either specify the mode manually or let Autopilot choose for you based on the dataset size by selecting AUTO. In AUTO mode, Autopilot chooses ENSEMBLING for datasets smaller than 100 MB, and HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING for larger ones. The ENSEMBLING mode uses a multi-stack ensemble model to predict classification and regression tasks directly from your dataset. This machine learning mode combines several base models to produce an optimal predictive model. It then uses a stacking ensemble method to combine predictions from contributing members. A multi-stack ensemble model can provide better performance over a single model by combining the predictive capabilities of multiple models. See Autopilot algorithm support for a list of algorithms supported by ENSEMBLING mode. The HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING (HPO) mode uses the best hyperparameters to train the best version of a model. HPO automatically selects an algorithm for the type of problem you want to solve. Then HPO finds the best hyperparameters according to your objective metric. See Autopilot algorithm support for a list of algorithms supported by HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING mode. GenerateCandidateDefinitionsOnly (boolean) --- Generates possible candidates without training the models. A model candidate is a combination of data preprocessors, algorithms, and algorithm parameter settings. ProblemType (string) --- The type of supervised learning problem available for the model candidates of the AutoML job V2. For more information, see SageMaker Autopilot problem types. The name of the target variable in supervised learning, usually represented by --\u0098y'. SampleWeightAttributeName (string) --- If specified, this column name indicates which column of the dataset should be treated as sample weights for use by the objective metric during the training, evaluation, and the selection of the best model. This column is not considered as a predictive feature. For more information on Autopilot metrics, see Metrics and validation. Sample weights should be numeric, non-negative, with larger values indicating which rows are more important than others. Data points that have invalid or no weight value are excluded. Support for sample weights is available in Ensembling mode only. TextGenerationJobConfig (dict) --- Settings used to configure an AutoML job V2 for the text generation (LLMs fine-tuning) problem type.

For information on the list of supported models, see Text generation models supporting fine-tuning in Autopilot. If no BaseModelName is provided, the default model used is Falcon7BInstruct. TextGenerationHyperParameters (dict) --- The hyperparameters used to configure and optimize the learning process of the base model. You can set any combination of the following hyperparameters for all base models. For more information on each supported hyperparameter, see Optimize the learning process of your text generation models with hyperparameters. \"epochCount\": The number of times the model goes through the entire training dataset. Its value should be a string containing an integer value within the range of '1' to '10'. \"batchSize\": The number of data samples used in each iteration of training.
