You must not delete an EndpointConfig in use by an endpoint that is live or while the UpdateEndpoint or CreateEndpoint operations are being performed on the endpoint. If you delete the EndpointConfig of an endpoint that is active or being created or updated you may lose visibility into the instance type the endpoint is using. The endpoint must be deleted in order to stop incurring charges.",
