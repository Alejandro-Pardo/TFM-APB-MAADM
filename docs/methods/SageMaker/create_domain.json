  "description": "Creates a Domain. A domain consists of an associated Amazon Elastic File System volume, a list of authorized users, and a variety of security, application, policy, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configurations. Users within a domain can share notebook files and other artifacts with each other. When a domain is created, an EFS volume is created for use by all of the users within the domain. Each user receives a private home directory within the EFS volume for notebooks, Git repositories, and data files. SageMaker AI uses the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) to encrypt the EFS volume attached to the domain with an Amazon Web Services managed key by default. For more control, you can specify a customer managed key. For more information, see Protect Data at Rest Using Encryption. All traffic between the domain and the Amazon EFS volume is through the specified VPC and subnets. For other traffic, you can specify the AppNetworkAccessType parameter. AppNetworkAccessType corresponds to the network access type that you choose when you onboard to the domain. The following options are available: For more information, see Connect Amazon SageMaker AI Studio Notebooks to Resources in a VPC.",
