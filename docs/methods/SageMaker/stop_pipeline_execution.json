  "description": "Stops a pipeline execution. A pipeline execution won't stop while a callback step is running. When you call StopPipelineExecution on a pipeline execution with a running callback step, SageMaker Pipelines sends an additional Amazon SQS message to the specified SQS queue. The body of the SQS message contains a 'Status' field which is set to 'Stopping'. You should add logic to your Amazon SQS message consumer to take any needed action (for example, resource cleanup) upon receipt of the message followed by a call to SendPipelineExecutionStepSuccess or SendPipelineExecutionStepFailure. Only when SageMaker Pipelines receives one of these calls will it stop the pipeline execution. A pipeline execution can't be stopped while a lambda step is running because the Lambda function invoked by the lambda step can't be stopped. If you attempt to stop the execution while the Lambda function is running, the pipeline waits for the Lambda function to finish or until the timeout is hit, whichever occurs first, and then stops. If the Lambda function finishes, the pipeline execution status is Stopped. If the timeout is hit the pipeline execution status is Failed.",
