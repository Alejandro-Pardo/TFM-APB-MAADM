  "description": "Stops a training job. To stop a job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms might use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of the training is not lost. When it receives a StopTrainingJob request, SageMaker changes the status of the job to Stopping. After SageMaker stops the job, it sets the status to Stopped.",
