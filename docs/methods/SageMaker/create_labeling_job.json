  "description": "Creates a job that uses workers to label the data objects in your input dataset. You can use the labeled data to train machine learning models. You can select your workforce from one of three providers: You can also use automated data labeling to reduce the number of data objects that need to be labeled by a human. Automated data labeling uses active learning to determine if a data object can be labeled by machine or if it needs to be sent to a human worker. For more information, see Using Automated Data Labeling. The data objects to be labeled are contained in an Amazon S3 bucket. You create a manifest file that describes the location of each object. For more information, see Using Input and Output Data. The output can be used as the manifest file for another labeling job or as training data for your machine learning models. You can use this operation to create a static labeling job or a streaming labeling job. A static labeling job stops if all data objects in the input manifest file identified in ManifestS3Uri have been labeled. A streaming labeling job runs perpetually until it is manually stopped, or remains idle for 10 days. You can send new data objects to an active ( InProgress) streaming labeling job in real time. To learn how to create a static labeling job, see Create a Labeling Job (API) in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.

(string) --- A title for the task for your human workers. A description of the task for your human workers. The number of human workers that will label an object. The amount of time that a worker has to complete a task. If you create a custom labeling job, the maximum value for this parameter is 8 hours (28,800 seconds). If you create a labeling job using a built-in task type the maximum for this parameter depends on the task type you use: For image and text labeling jobs, the maximum is 8 hours (28,800 seconds). For 3D point cloud and video frame labeling jobs, the maximum is 30 days (2952,000 seconds) for non-AL mode. For most users, the maximum is also 30 days. TaskAvailabilityLifetimeInSeconds (integer) --- The length of time that a task remains available for labeling by human workers. The default and maximum values for this parameter depend on the type of workforce you use. If you choose the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce, the maximum is 12 hours (43,200 seconds). The default is 6 hours (21,600 seconds). If you choose a private or vendor workforce, the default value is 30 days (2592,000 seconds) for non-AL mode. MaxConcurrentTaskCount (integer) --- Defines the maximum number of data objects that can be labeled by human workers at the same time. Also referred to as batch size. Each object may have more than one worker at one time. The default value is 1000 objects. To increase the maximum value to 5000 objects, contact Amazon Web Services Support. AnnotationConsolidationConfig (dict) --- Configures how labels are consolidated across human workers. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Lambda function implements the logic for annotation consolidation and to process output data. For built-in task types, use one of the following Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Lambda function ARNs for AnnotationConsolidationLambdaArn.
