  "description": "Creates an endpoint using the endpoint configuration specified in the request. SageMaker uses the endpoint to provision resources and deploy models. You create the endpoint configuration with the CreateEndpointConfig API. Use this API to deploy models using SageMaker hosting services. The endpoint name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region in your Amazon Web Services account. When it receives the request, SageMaker creates the endpoint, launches the resources (ML compute instances), and deploys the model(s) on them. When SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status to Creating. After it creates the endpoint, it sets the status to InService. SageMaker can then process incoming requests for inferences. To check the status of an endpoint, use the DescribeEndpoint API. If any of the models hosted at this endpoint get model data from an Amazon S3 location, SageMaker uses Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to download model artifacts from the S3 path you provided. Amazon Web Services STS is activated in your Amazon Web Services account by default. If you previously deactivated Amazon Web Services STS for a region, you need to reactivate Amazon Web Services STS for that region. For more information, see Activating and Deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon Web Services Region in the Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide.",

BlueGreenUpdatePolicy (dict) --- Update policy for a blue/green deployment. If this update policy is specified, SageMaker creates a new fleet during the deployment while maintaining the old fleet. SageMaker flips traffic to the new fleet according to the specified traffic routing configuration. Only one update policy should be used in the deployment configuration. If no update policy is specified, SageMaker uses a blue/green deployment strategy with all at once traffic shifting by default. Defines the traffic routing strategy to shift traffic from the old fleet to the new fleet during an endpoint deployment. Traffic routing strategy type. ALL_AT_ONCE: Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in a single step. CANARY: Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in two steps. The first step is the canary, which is a small portion of the traffic. The second step is the remainder of the traffic. LINEAR: Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in n steps of a configurable size. The waiting time (in seconds) between incremental steps to turn on traffic on the new endpoint fleet. CanarySize (dict) --- Batch size for the first step to turn on traffic on the new endpoint fleet. Value must be less than or equal to 50% of the variant's total instance count. Specifies the endpoint capacity type. INSTANCE_COUNT: The endpoint activates based on the number of instances. CAPACITY_PERCENT: The endpoint activates based on the specified percentage of capacity. Defines the capacity size, either as a number of instances or a capacity percentage. LinearStepSize (dict) --- Batch size for each step to turn on traffic on the new endpoint fleet. Value must be 10-50% of the variant's total instance count. TerminationWaitInSeconds (integer) --- Additional waiting time in seconds after the completion of an endpoint deployment before terminating the old endpoint fleet. Default is 0. MaximumExecutionTimeoutInSeconds (integer) --- Maximum execution timeout for the deployment. Note that the timeout value should be larger than the total waiting time specified in TerminationWaitInSeconds and WaitIntervalInSeconds. RollingUpdatePolicy (dict) --- Specifies a rolling deployment strategy for updating a SageMaker endpoint. Batch size for each rolling step to provision capacity and turn on traffic on the new endpoint fleet, and terminate capacity on the old endpoint fleet. Value must be between 5% to 50% of the variant's total instance count. The length of the baking period, during which SageMaker monitors alarms for each batch on the new fleet. MaximumExecutionTimeoutInSeconds (integer) --- The time limit for the total deployment. Exceeding this limit causes a timeout. RollbackMaximumBatchSize (dict) --- Batch size for rollback to the old endpoint fleet. Each rolling step to provision capacity and turn on traffic on the old endpoint fleet, and terminate capacity on the new endpoint fleet. If this field is absent, the default value will be set to 100% of total capacity which means to bring up the whole capacity of the old fleet at once during rollback. AutoRollbackConfiguration (dict) --- Automatic rollback configuration for handling endpoint deployment failures and recovery. Alarms (list) --- List of CloudWatch alarms in your account that are configured to monitor metrics on an endpoint. If any alarms are tripped during a deployment, SageMaker rolls back the deployment. (dict) --- An Amazon CloudWatch alarm configured to monitor metrics on an endpoint. AlarmName (string) --- The name of a CloudWatch alarm in your account.",
