      "description": "An array of inputs configuring the data to download into the processing container. (dict) --- The inputs for a processing job. The processing input must specify exactly one of either S3Input or DatasetDefinition types. The name for the processing job input. AppManaged (boolean) --- When True, input operations such as data download are managed natively by the processing job application. When False (default), input operations are managed by Amazon SageMaker. S3Input (dict) --- Configuration for downloading input data from Amazon S3 into the processing container. The URI of the Amazon S3 prefix Amazon SageMaker downloads data required to run a processing job. LocalPath (string) --- The local path in your container where you want Amazon SageMaker to write input data to. LocalPath is an absolute path to the input data and must begin with /opt/ml/processing/. LocalPath is a required parameter when AppManaged is False (default). Whether you use an S3Prefix or a ManifestFile for the data type. If you choose S3Prefix, S3Uri identifies a key name prefix. Amazon SageMaker uses all objects with the specified key name prefix for the processing job. If you choose ManifestFile, S3Uri identifies an object that is a manifest file containing a list of object keys that you want Amazon SageMaker to use for the processing job. S3InputMode (string) --- Whether to use File or Pipe input mode. In File mode, Amazon SageMaker copies the data from the input source onto the local ML storage volume before starting your processing container. This is the most commonly used input mode. In Pipe mode, Amazon SageMaker streams input data from the source directly to your processing container into named pipes without using the ML storage volume. S3DataDistributionType (string) --- Whether to distribute the data from Amazon S3 to all processing instances with FullyReplicated, or whether the data from Amazon S3 is shared by Amazon S3 key, downloading one shard of data to each processing instance. S3CompressionType (string) --- Whether to GZIP-decompress the data in Amazon S3 as it is streamed into the processing container. Gzip can only be used when Pipe mode is specified as the S3InputMode. In Pipe mode, Amazon SageMaker streams input data from the source directly to your container without using the EBS volume. DatasetDefinition (dict) --- Configuration for a Dataset Definition input. AthenaDatasetDefinition (dict) --- Configuration for Athena Dataset Definition input. The name of the data catalog used in Athena query execution. The name of the database used in the Athena query execution. The SQL query statements, to be executed. WorkGroup (string) --- The name of the workgroup in which the Athena query is being started. The location in Amazon S3 where Athena query results are stored. KmsKeyId (string) --- The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt data generated from an Athena query execution. The data storage format for Athena query results. OutputCompression (string) --- The compression used for Athena query results. RedshiftDatasetDefinition (dict) --- Configuration for Redshift Dataset Definition input. The Redshift cluster Identifier. The name of the Redshift database used in Redshift query execution. The database user name used in Redshift query execution. The SQL query statements to be executed. The IAM role attached to your Redshift cluster that Amazon SageMaker uses to generate datasets. The location in Amazon S3 where the Redshift query results are stored. KmsKeyId (string) --- The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt data from a Redshift execution. The data storage format for Redshift query results. OutputCompression (string) --- The compression used for Redshift query results. LocalPath (string) --- The local path where you want Amazon SageMaker to download the Dataset Definition inputs to run a processing job. LocalPath is an absolute path to the input data. This is a required parameter when AppManaged is False (default). DataDistributionType (string) --- Whether the generated dataset is FullyReplicated or ShardedByS3Key (default). InputMode (string) --- Whether to use File or Pipe input mode. In File (default) mode, Amazon SageMaker copies the data from the input source onto the local Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes before starting your training algorithm. In Pipe mode, Amazon SageMaker streams input data from the source directly to your algorithm without using the EBS volume.",
