      "description": "A Boolean conditional statement. Resources must satisfy this condition to be included in search results. You must provide at least one subexpression, filter, or nested filter. The maximum number of recursive SubExpressions, NestedFilters, and Filters that can be included in a SearchExpression object is 50. Filters (list) --- A list of filter objects. (dict) --- A conditional statement for a search expression that includes a resource property, a Boolean operator, and a value. Resources that match the statement are returned in the results from the Search API. If you specify a Value, but not an Operator, SageMaker uses the equals operator. In search, there are several property types: Metrics To define a metric filter, enter a value using the form \"Metrics.<name>\", where <name> is a metric name. For example, the following filter searches for training jobs with an \"accuracy\" metric greater than \"0.9\": { \"Name\": \"Metrics.accuracy\", \"Operator\": \"GreaterThan\", \"Value\": \"0.9\" } HyperParameters To define a hyperparameter filter, enter a value with the form \"HyperParameters.<name>\". Decimal hyperparameter values are treated as a decimal in a comparison if the specified Value is also a decimal value. If the specified Value is an integer, the decimal hyperparameter values are treated as integers. For example, the following filter is satisfied by training jobs with a \"learning_rate\" hyperparameter that is less than \"0.5\": { \"Name\": \"HyperParameters.learning_rate\", \"Operator\": \"LessThan\", \"Value\": \"0.5\" } Tags To define a tag filter, enter a value with the form Tags.<key>. A resource property name. For example, TrainingJobName. For valid property names, see SearchRecord. You must specify a valid property for the resource. Operator (string) --- A Boolean binary operator that is used to evaluate the filter. The operator field contains one of the following values: Equals The value of Name equals Value. NotEquals The value of Name doesn't equal Value. Exists The Name property exists. NotExists The Name property does not exist. GreaterThan The value of Name is greater than Value. Not supported for text properties. GreaterThanOrEqualTo The value of Name is greater than or equal to Value. LessThan The value of Name is less than Value. LessThanOrEqualTo The value of Name is less than or equal to Value. In The value of Name is one of the comma delimited strings in Value. Only supported for text properties. Contains The value of Name contains the string Value. A SearchExpression can include the Contains operator multiple times when the value of Name is one of the following: Experiment.DisplayName Experiment.ExperimentName Experiment.Tags Trial.DisplayName Trial.TrialName Trial.Tags TrialComponent.DisplayName TrialComponent.TrialComponentName TrialComponent.Tags TrialComponent.InputArtifacts TrialComponent.OutputArtifacts A SearchExpression can include only one Contains operator for all other values of Name. In these cases, if you include multiple Contains operators in the SearchExpression, the result is the following error message: ' 'CONTAINS' operator usage limit of 1 exceeded.' Value (string) --- A value used with Name and Operator to determine which resources satisfy the filter's condition. For numerical properties, Value must be an integer or floating-point decimal. For timestamp properties, Value must be an ISO 8601 date-time string of the following format: YYYY-mm-dd'T'HH:MM:SS. NestedFilters (list) --- A list of nested filter objects. (dict) --- A list of nested Filter objects. A resource must satisfy the conditions of all filters to be included in the results returned from the Search API. For example, to filter on a training job's InputDataConfig property with a specific channel name and S3Uri prefix, define the following filters: '{Name:\"InputDataConfig.ChannelName\", \"Operator\":\"Equals\", \"Value\":\"train\"}', '{Name:\"InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3DataSource.S3Uri\", \"Operator\":\"Contains\", \"Value\":\"mybucket/catdata\"}' The name of the property to use in the nested filters. The value must match a listed property name, such as InputDataConfig. A list of filters. Each filter acts on a property. Filters must contain at least one Filters value. For example, a NestedFilters call might include a filter on the PropertyName parameter of the InputDataConfig property: InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3DataSource.S3Uri. SubExpressions (list) --- A list of search expression objects. (dict) --- A multi-expression that searches for the specified resource or resources in a search. All resource objects that satisfy the expression's condition are included in the search results. You must specify at least one subexpression, filter, or nested filter. A SearchExpression can contain up to twenty elements. A SearchExpression contains the following components: A list of Filter objects. Each filter defines a simple Boolean expression comprised of a resource property name, Boolean operator, and value. A list of NestedFilter objects. Each nested filter defines a list of Boolean expressions using a list of resource properties. A nested filter is satisfied if a single object in the list satisfies all Boolean expressions. A list of SearchExpression objects. A search expression object can be nested in a list of search expression objects. A Boolean operator: And or Or. Operator (string) --- A Boolean operator used to evaluate the search expression. If you want every conditional statement in all lists to be satisfied for the entire search expression to be true, specify And. If only a single conditional statement needs to be true for the entire search expression to be true, specify Or. The default value is And.",
