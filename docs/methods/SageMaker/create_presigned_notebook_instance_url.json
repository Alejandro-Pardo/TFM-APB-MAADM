  "description": "Returns a URL that you can use to connect to the Jupyter server from a notebook instance. In the SageMaker AI console, when you choose Open next to a notebook instance, SageMaker AI opens a new tab showing the Jupyter server home page from the notebook instance. The console uses this API to get the URL and show the page. The IAM role or user used to call this API defines the permissions to access the notebook instance. Once the presigned URL is created, no additional permission is required to access this URL. IAM authorization policies for this API are also enforced for every HTTP request and WebSocket frame that attempts to connect to the notebook instance. You can restrict access to this API and to the URL that it returns to a list of IP addresses that you specify. Use the NotIpAddress condition operator and the aws:SourceIP condition context key to specify the list of IP addresses that you want to have access to the notebook instance. For more information, see Limit Access to a Notebook Instance by IP Address.",
