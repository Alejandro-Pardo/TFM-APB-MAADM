      "description": "Specifies details about inference jobs that you can run with models based on this model package, including the following information: The Amazon ECR paths of containers that contain the inference code and model artifacts. The instance types that the model package supports for transform jobs and real-time endpoints used for inference. The input and output content formats that the model package supports for inference. The Amazon ECR registry path of the Docker image that contains the inference code. (dict) --- Describes the Docker container for the model package. ContainerHostname (string) --- The DNS host name for the Docker container. The Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) path where inference code is stored. If you are using your own custom algorithm instead of an algorithm provided by SageMaker, the inference code must meet SageMaker requirements. SageMaker supports both registry/repository[:tag] and registry/repository[@digest] image path formats. For more information, see Using Your Own Algorithms with Amazon SageMaker. ImageDigest (string) --- An MD5 hash of the training algorithm that identifies the Docker image used for training. ModelDataUrl (string) --- The Amazon S3 path where the model artifacts, which result from model training, are stored. This path must point to a single gzip compressed tar archive ( .tar.gz suffix). ModelDataSource (dict) --- Specifies the location of ML model data to deploy during endpoint creation. S3DataSource (dict) --- Specifies the S3 location of ML model data to deploy. Specifies the S3 path of ML model data to deploy. Specifies the type of ML model data to deploy. If you choose S3Prefix, S3Uri identifies a key name prefix. SageMaker uses all objects that match the specified key name prefix as part of the ML model data to deploy. A valid key name prefix identified by S3Uri always ends with a forward slash (/). If you choose S3Object, S3Uri identifies an object that is the ML model data to deploy. Specifies how the ML model data is prepared. If you choose Gzip and choose S3Object as the value of S3DataType, S3Uri identifies an object that is a gzip-compressed TAR archive. SageMaker will attempt to decompress and untar the object during model deployment. If you choose None and chooose S3Object as the value of S3DataType, S3Uri identifies an object that represents an uncompressed ML model to deploy. If you choose None and choose S3Prefix as the value of S3DataType, S3Uri identifies a key name prefix, under which all objects represents the uncompressed ML model to deploy. If you choose None, then SageMaker will follow rules below when creating model data files under /opt/ml/model directory for use by your inference code: If you choose S3Object as the value of S3DataType, then SageMaker will split the key of the S3 object referenced by S3Uri by slash (/), and use the last part as the filename of the file holding the content of the S3 object. If you choose S3Prefix as the value of S3DataType, then for each S3 object under the key name pefix referenced by S3Uri, SageMaker will trim its key by the prefix, and use the remainder as the path (relative to /opt/ml/model) of the file holding the content of the S3 object. SageMaker will split the remainder by slash (/), using intermediate parts as directory names and the last part as filename of the file holding the content of the S3 object. Do not use any of the following as file names or directory names: An empty or blank string A string which contains null bytes A string longer than 255 bytes A single dot ( .) A double dot ( ..) Ambiguous file names will result in model deployment failure. For example, if your uncompressed ML model consists of two S3 objects s3://mybucket/model/weights and s3://mybucket/model/weights/part1 and you specify s3://mybucket/model/ as the value of S3Uri and S3Prefix as the value of S3DataType, then it will result in name clash between /opt/ml/model/weights (a regular file) and /opt/ml/model/weights/ (a directory). Do not organize the model artifacts in S3 console using folders. When you create a folder in S3 console, S3 creates a 0-byte object with a key set to the folder name you provide. They key of the 0-byte object ends with a slash (/) which violates SageMaker restrictions on model artifact file names, leading to model deployment failure. ModelAccessConfig (dict) --- Specifies the access configuration file for the ML model. You can explicitly accept the model end-user license agreement (EULA) within the ModelAccessConfig. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with any applicable license terms and making sure they are acceptable for your use case before downloading or using a model. Specifies agreement to the model end-user license agreement (EULA). The AcceptEula value must be explicitly defined as True in order to accept the EULA that this model requires. HubAccessConfig (dict) --- Configuration information for hub access. The ARN of the hub content for which deployment access is allowed. ManifestS3Uri (string) --- The Amazon S3 URI of the manifest file. The manifest file is a CSV file that stores the artifact locations. ETag (string) --- The ETag associated with S3 URI. ManifestEtag (string) --- The ETag associated with Manifest S3 URI. ProductId (string) --- The Amazon Web Services Marketplace product ID of the model package. Environment (dict) --- The environment variables to set in the Docker container. Each key and value in the Environment string to string map can have length of up to 1024.

Framework (string) --- The machine learning framework of the model package container image. FrameworkVersion (string) --- The framework version of the Model Package Container Image. NearestModelName (string) --- The name of a pre-trained machine learning benchmarked by Amazon SageMaker Inference Recommender model that matches your model. You can find a list of benchmarked models by calling ListModelMetadata. AdditionalS3DataSource (dict) --- The additional data source that is used during inference in the Docker container for your model package. The data type of the additional data source that you specify for use in inference or training. The uniform resource identifier (URI) used to identify an additional data source used in inference or training. CompressionType (string) --- The type of compression used for an additional data source used in inference or training. Specify None if your additional data source is not compressed. ModelDataETag (string) --- The ETag associated with Model Data URL. SupportedTransformInstanceTypes (list) --- A list of the instance types on which a transformation job can be run or on which an endpoint can be deployed. This parameter is required for unversioned models, and optional for versioned models.

      "description": "Specifies configurations for one or more transform jobs that SageMaker runs to test the model package. The IAM roles to be used for the validation of the model package. An array of ModelPackageValidationProfile objects, each of which specifies a batch transform job that SageMaker runs to validate your model package. (dict) --- Contains data, such as the inputs and targeted instance types that are used in the process of validating the model package. The data provided in the validation profile is made available to your buyers on Amazon Web Services Marketplace. The name of the profile for the model package. The TransformJobDefinition object that describes the transform job used for the validation of the model package. MaxConcurrentTransforms (integer) --- The maximum number of parallel requests that can be sent to each instance in a transform job. The default value is 1. MaxPayloadInMB (integer) --- The maximum payload size allowed, in MB. A payload is the data portion of a record (without metadata). BatchStrategy (string) --- A string that determines the number of records included in a single mini-batch. SingleRecord means only one record is used per mini-batch. MultiRecord means a mini-batch is set to contain as many records that can fit within the MaxPayloadInMB limit. Environment (dict) --- The environment variables to set in the Docker container. We support up to 16 key and values entries in the map. (string) --- (string) --- A description of the input source and the way the transform job consumes it. Describes the location of the channel data, which is, the S3 location of the input data that the model can consume. The S3 location of the data source that is associated with a channel. If you choose S3Prefix, S3Uri identifies a key name prefix. Amazon SageMaker uses all objects with the specified key name prefix for batch transform. If you choose ManifestFile, S3Uri identifies an object that is a manifest file containing a list of object keys that you want Amazon SageMaker to use for batch transform. The following values are compatible: ManifestFile, S3Prefix The following value is not compatible: AugmentedManifestFile Depending on the value specified for the S3DataType, identifies either a key name prefix or a manifest. For example: A key name prefix might look like this: s3://bucketname/exampleprefix/. A manifest might look like this: s3://bucketname/example.manifest The manifest is an S3 object which is a JSON file with the following format: [ {\"prefix\": \"s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/\"}, \"relative/path/to/custdata-1\", \"relative/path/custdata-2\", ... \"relative/path/custdata-N\" ] The preceding JSON matches the following S3Uris: s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/to/custdata-1 s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/custdata-2 ... s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/custdata-N The complete set of S3Uris in this manifest constitutes the input data for the channel for this datasource. The object that each S3Uris points to must be readable by the IAM role that Amazon SageMaker uses to perform tasks on your behalf. ContentType (string) --- The multipurpose internet mail extension (MIME) type of the data. Amazon SageMaker uses the MIME type with each http call to transfer data to the transform job. CompressionType (string) --- If your transform data is compressed, specify the compression type. Amazon SageMaker automatically decompresses the data for the transform job accordingly. The default value is None. SplitType (string) --- The method to use to split the transform job's data files into smaller batches. Splitting is necessary when the total size of each object is too large to fit in a single request. You can also use data splitting to improve performance by processing multiple concurrent mini-batches. The default value for SplitType is None, which indicates that input data files are not split, and request payloads contain the entire contents of an input object. Set the value of this parameter to Line to split records on a newline character boundary. SplitType also supports a number of record-oriented binary data formats. Currently, the supported record formats are: RecordIO TFRecord When splitting is enabled, the size of a mini-batch depends on the values of the BatchStrategy and MaxPayloadInMB parameters. When the value of BatchStrategy is MultiRecord, Amazon SageMaker sends the maximum number of records in each request, up to the MaxPayloadInMB limit. If the value of BatchStrategy is SingleRecord, Amazon SageMaker sends individual records in each request. Identifies the Amazon S3 location where you want Amazon SageMaker to save the results from the transform job. The Amazon S3 path where you want Amazon SageMaker to store the results of the transform job. For example, s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix. For every S3 object used as input for the transform job, batch transform stores the transformed data with an . out suffix in a corresponding subfolder in the location in the output prefix. For example, for the input data stored at s3://bucket-name/input-name-prefix/dataset01/data.csv, batch transform stores the transformed data at s3://bucket-name/output-name-prefix/input-name-prefix/data.csv.out. Batch transform doesn't upload partially processed objects. For an input S3 object that contains multiple records, it creates an . out file only if the transform job succeeds on the entire file. When the input contains multiple S3 objects, the batch transform job processes the listed S3 objects and uploads only the output for successfully processed objects. If any object fails in the transform job batch transform marks the job as failed to prompt investigation. Accept (string) --- The MIME type used to specify the output data. Amazon SageMaker uses the MIME type with each http call to transfer data from the transform job. AssembleWith (string) --- Defines how to assemble the results of the transform job as a single S3 object. Choose a format that is most convenient to you. To concatenate the results in binary format, specify None. To add a newline character at the end of every transformed record, specify Line. KmsKeyId (string) --- The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt the model artifacts at rest using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. The KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats: Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias Alias name ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the default KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's account. For more information, see KMS-Managed Encryption Keys in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. The KMS key policy must grant permission to the IAM role that you specify in your CreateModel request. For more information, see Using Key Policies in Amazon Web Services KMS in the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service Developer Guide. Identifies the ML compute instances for the transform job. The ML compute instance type for the transform job. If you are using built-in algorithms to transform moderately sized datasets, we recommend using ml.m4.xlarge or ``ml.m5.large``instance types. The number of ML compute instances to use in the transform job. The default value is 1, and the maximum is 100. For distributed transform jobs, specify a value greater than 1. VolumeKmsKeyId (string) --- The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt model data on the storage volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that run the batch transform job. The VolumeKmsKeyId can be any of the following formats: Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias Alias name ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias TransformAmiVersion (string) --- Specifies an option from a collection of preconfigured Amazon Machine Image (AMI) images. Each image is configured by Amazon Web Services with a set of software and driver versions. al2-ami-sagemaker-batch-gpu-470 Accelerator: GPU NVIDIA driver version: 470 al2-ami-sagemaker-batch-gpu-535 Accelerator: GPU NVIDIA driver version: 535",

Batch transform doesn't upload partially processed objects. For an input S3 object that contains multiple records, it creates an . out file only if the transform job succeeds on the entire file. When the input contains multiple S3 objects, the batch transform job processes the listed S3 objects and uploads only the output for successfully processed objects. If any object fails in the transform job batch transform marks the job as failed to prompt investigation.",

      "description": "Details about the algorithm that was used to create the model package. A list of the algorithms that were used to create a model package. (dict) --- Specifies an algorithm that was used to create the model package. The algorithm must be either an algorithm resource in your SageMaker account or an algorithm in Amazon Web Services Marketplace that you are subscribed to. ModelDataUrl (string) --- The Amazon S3 path where the model artifacts, which result from model training, are stored. This path must point to a single gzip compressed tar archive ( .tar.gz suffix). ModelDataSource (dict) --- Specifies the location of ML model data to deploy during endpoint creation. S3DataSource (dict) --- Specifies the S3 location of ML model data to deploy. Specifies the S3 path of ML model data to deploy. Specifies the type of ML model data to deploy. If you choose S3Prefix, S3Uri identifies a key name prefix. SageMaker uses all objects that match the specified key name prefix as part of the ML model data to deploy. A valid key name prefix identified by S3Uri always ends with a forward slash (/). If you choose S3Object, S3Uri identifies an object that is the ML model data to deploy. Specifies how the ML model data is prepared. If you choose Gzip and choose S3Object as the value of S3DataType, S3Uri identifies an object that is a gzip-compressed TAR archive. SageMaker will attempt to decompress and untar the object during model deployment. If you choose None and chooose S3Object as the value of S3DataType, S3Uri identifies an object that represents an uncompressed ML model to deploy. If you choose None and choose S3Prefix as the value of S3DataType, S3Uri identifies a key name prefix, under which all objects represents the uncompressed ML model to deploy. If you choose None, then SageMaker will follow rules below when creating model data files under /opt/ml/model directory for use by your inference code: If you choose S3Object as the value of S3DataType, then SageMaker will split the key of the S3 object referenced by S3Uri by slash (/), and use the last part as the filename of the file holding the content of the S3 object. If you choose S3Prefix as the value of S3DataType, then for each S3 object under the key name pefix referenced by S3Uri, SageMaker will trim its key by the prefix, and use the remainder as the path (relative to /opt/ml/model) of the file holding the content of the S3 object. SageMaker will split the remainder by slash (/), using intermediate parts as directory names and the last part as filename of the file holding the content of the S3 object. Do not use any of the following as file names or directory names: An empty or blank string A string which contains null bytes A string longer than 255 bytes A single dot ( .) A double dot ( ..) Ambiguous file names will result in model deployment failure. For example, if your uncompressed ML model consists of two S3 objects s3://mybucket/model/weights and s3://mybucket/model/weights/part1 and you specify s3://mybucket/model/ as the value of S3Uri and S3Prefix as the value of S3DataType, then it will result in name clash between /opt/ml/model/weights (a regular file) and /opt/ml/model/weights/ (a directory). Do not organize the model artifacts in S3 console using folders. When you create a folder in S3 console, S3 creates a 0-byte object with a key set to the folder name you provide. They key of the 0-byte object ends with a slash (/) which violates SageMaker restrictions on model artifact file names, leading to model deployment failure. ModelAccessConfig (dict) --- Specifies the access configuration file for the ML model. You can explicitly accept the model end-user license agreement (EULA) within the ModelAccessConfig. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with any applicable license terms and making sure they are acceptable for your use case before downloading or using a model. Specifies agreement to the model end-user license agreement (EULA). The AcceptEula value must be explicitly defined as True in order to accept the EULA that this model requires. HubAccessConfig (dict) --- Configuration information for hub access. The ARN of the hub content for which deployment access is allowed. ManifestS3Uri (string) --- The Amazon S3 URI of the manifest file. The manifest file is a CSV file that stores the artifact locations. ETag (string) --- The ETag associated with S3 URI. ManifestEtag (string) --- The ETag associated with Manifest S3 URI. ModelDataETag (string) --- The ETag associated with Model Data URL.

Each additional Inference Specification specifies artifacts based on this model package that can be used on inference endpoints. Generally used with SageMaker Neo to store the compiled artifacts. (dict) --- A structure of additional Inference Specification. Additional Inference Specification specifies details about inference jobs that can be run with models based on this model package A unique name to identify the additional inference specification. The name must be unique within the list of your additional inference specifications for a particular model package. Description (string) --- A description of the additional Inference specification The Amazon ECR registry path of the Docker image that contains the inference code. (dict) --- Describes the Docker container for the model package. ContainerHostname (string) --- The DNS host name for the Docker container. The Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) path where inference code is stored. If you are using your own custom algorithm instead of an algorithm provided by SageMaker, the inference code must meet SageMaker requirements. SageMaker supports both registry/repository[:tag] and registry/repository[@digest] image path formats. For more information, see Using Your Own Algorithms with Amazon SageMaker. ImageDigest (string) --- An MD5 hash of the training algorithm that identifies the Docker image used for training. ModelDataUrl (string) --- The Amazon S3 path where the model artifacts, which result from model training, are stored. This path must point to a single gzip compressed tar archive ( .tar.gz suffix). ModelDataSource (dict) --- Specifies the location of ML model data to deploy during endpoint creation. S3DataSource (dict) --- Specifies the S3 location of ML model data to deploy. Specifies the S3 path of ML model data to deploy. Specifies the type of ML model data to deploy. If you choose S3Prefix, S3Uri identifies a key name prefix. SageMaker uses all objects that match the specified key name prefix as part of the ML model data to deploy. A valid key name prefix identified by S3Uri always ends with a forward slash (/). If you choose S3Object, S3Uri identifies an object that is the ML model data to deploy. Specifies how the ML model data is prepared. If you choose Gzip and choose S3Object as the value of S3DataType, S3Uri identifies an object that is a gzip-compressed TAR archive. SageMaker will attempt to decompress and untar the object during model deployment. If you choose None and chooose S3Object as the value of S3DataType, S3Uri identifies an object that represents an uncompressed ML model to deploy. If you choose None and choose S3Prefix as the value of S3DataType, S3Uri identifies a key name prefix, under which all objects represents the uncompressed ML model to deploy. If you choose None, then SageMaker will follow rules below when creating model data files under /opt/ml/model directory for use by your inference code: If you choose S3Object as the value of S3DataType, then SageMaker will split the key of the S3 object referenced by S3Uri by slash (/), and use the last part as the filename of the file holding the content of the S3 object. If you choose S3Prefix as the value of S3DataType, then for each S3 object under the key name pefix referenced by S3Uri, SageMaker will trim its key by the prefix, and use the remainder as the path (relative to /opt/ml/model) of the file holding the content of the S3 object. SageMaker will split the remainder by slash (/), using intermediate parts as directory names and the last part as filename of the file holding the content of the S3 object. Do not use any of the following as file names or directory names: An empty or blank string A string which contains null bytes A string longer than 255 bytes A single dot ( .) A double dot ( ..) Ambiguous file names will result in model deployment failure. For example, if your uncompressed ML model consists of two S3 objects s3://mybucket/model/weights and s3://mybucket/model/weights/part1 and you specify s3://mybucket/model/ as the value of S3Uri and S3Prefix as the value of S3DataType, then it will result in name clash between /opt/ml/model/weights (a regular file) and /opt/ml/model/weights/ (a directory). Do not organize the model artifacts in S3 console using folders. When you create a folder in S3 console, S3 creates a 0-byte object with a key set to the folder name you provide. They key of the 0-byte object ends with a slash (/) which violates SageMaker restrictions on model artifact file names, leading to model deployment failure. ModelAccessConfig (dict) --- Specifies the access configuration file for the ML model. You can explicitly accept the model end-user license agreement (EULA) within the ModelAccessConfig. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with any applicable license terms and making sure they are acceptable for your use case before downloading or using a model. Specifies agreement to the model end-user license agreement (EULA). The AcceptEula value must be explicitly defined as True in order to accept the EULA that this model requires. HubAccessConfig (dict) --- Configuration information for hub access. The ARN of the hub content for which deployment access is allowed. ManifestS3Uri (string) --- The Amazon S3 URI of the manifest file. The manifest file is a CSV file that stores the artifact locations. ETag (string) --- The ETag associated with S3 URI. ManifestEtag (string) --- The ETag associated with Manifest S3 URI. ProductId (string) --- The Amazon Web Services Marketplace product ID of the model package. Environment (dict) --- The environment variables to set in the Docker container. Each key and value in the Environment string to string map can have length of up to 1024. We support up to 16 entries in the map. (string) --- (string) --- ModelInput (dict) --- A structure with Model Input details. The input configuration object for the model. Framework (string) --- The machine learning framework of the model package container image. FrameworkVersion (string) --- The framework version of the Model Package Container Image. NearestModelName (string) --- The name of a pre-trained machine learning benchmarked by Amazon SageMaker Inference Recommender model that matches your model. You can find a list of benchmarked models by calling ListModelMetadata. AdditionalS3DataSource (dict) --- The additional data source that is used during inference in the Docker container for your model package. The data type of the additional data source that you specify for use in inference or training. The uniform resource identifier (URI) used to identify an additional data source used in inference or training. CompressionType (string) --- The type of compression used for an additional data source used in inference or training. Specify None if your additional data source is not compressed. ModelDataETag (string) --- The ETag associated with Model Data URL. SupportedTransformInstanceTypes (list) --- A list of the instance types on which a transformation job can be run or on which an endpoint can be deployed. (string) --- SupportedRealtimeInferenceInstanceTypes (list) --- A list of the instance types that are used to generate inferences in real-time. (string) --- SupportedContentTypes (list) --- The supported MIME types for the input data. (string) --- SupportedResponseMIMETypes (list) --- The supported MIME types for the output data.
