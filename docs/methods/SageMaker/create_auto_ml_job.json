  "description": "Creates an Autopilot job also referred to as Autopilot experiment or AutoML job. An AutoML job in SageMaker AI is a fully automated process that allows you to build machine learning models with minimal effort and machine learning expertise. When initiating an AutoML job, you provide your data and optionally specify parameters tailored to your use case. SageMaker AI then automates the entire model development lifecycle, including data preprocessing, model training, tuning, and evaluation. AutoML jobs are designed to simplify and accelerate the model building process by automating various tasks and exploring different combinations of machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter values. The output of an AutoML job comprises one or more trained models ready for deployment and inference. Additionally, SageMaker AI AutoML jobs generate a candidate model leaderboard, allowing you to select the best-performing model for deployment. For more information about AutoML jobs, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-automate-model-development.html in the SageMaker AI developer guide. You can find the best-performing model after you run an AutoML job by calling DescribeAutoMLJobV2 (recommended) or DescribeAutoMLJob.",

CompletionCriteria (dict) --- How long an AutoML job is allowed to run, or how many candidates a job is allowed to generate. MaxCandidates (integer) --- The maximum number of times a training job is allowed to run. For text and image classification, time-series forecasting, as well as text generation (LLMs fine-tuning) problem types, the supported value is 1. For tabular problem types, the maximum value is 750. MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds (integer) --- The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job executed inside hyperparameter tuning is allowed to run as part of a hyperparameter tuning job. For more information, see the StoppingCondition used by the CreateHyperParameterTuningJob action. For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2), this field controls the runtime of the job candidate. For TextGenerationJobConfig problem types, the maximum time defaults to 72 hours (259200 seconds). MaxAutoMLJobRuntimeInSeconds (integer) --- The maximum runtime, in seconds, an AutoML job has to complete. If an AutoML job exceeds the maximum runtime, the job is stopped automatically and its processing is ended gracefully. The AutoML job identifies the best model whose training was completed and marks it as the best-performing model. Any unfinished steps of the job, such as automatic one-click Autopilot model deployment, are not completed. SecurityConfig (dict) --- The security configuration for traffic encryption or Amazon VPC settings. VolumeKmsKeyId (string) --- The key used to encrypt stored data. EnableInterContainerTrafficEncryption (boolean) --- Whether to use traffic encryption between the container layers. VpcConfig (dict) --- The VPC configuration. The VPC security group IDs, in the form sg-xxxxxxxx. Specify the security groups for the VPC that is specified in the Subnets field. (string) --- The ID of the subnets in the VPC to which you want to connect your training job or model. For information about the availability of specific instance types, see Supported Instance Types and Availability Zones. (string) --- CandidateGenerationConfig (dict) --- The configuration for generating a candidate for an AutoML job (optional). FeatureSpecificationS3Uri (string) --- A URL to the Amazon S3 data source containing selected features from the input data source to run an Autopilot job. You can input FeatureAttributeNames (optional) in JSON format as shown below: { \"FeatureAttributeNames\":[\"col1\", \"col2\", ...] }. You can also specify the data type of the feature (optional) in the format shown below: { \"FeatureDataTypes\":{\"col1\":\"numeric\", \"col2\":\"categorical\" ... } } In ensembling mode, Autopilot only supports the following data types: numeric, categorical, text, and datetime. In HPO mode, Autopilot can support numeric, categorical, text, datetime, and sequence. If only FeatureDataTypes is provided, the column keys ( col1, col2,..) should be a subset of the column names in the input data. If both FeatureDataTypes and FeatureAttributeNames are provided, then the column keys should be a subset of the column names provided in FeatureAttributeNames. The key name FeatureAttributeNames is fixed. The values listed in [\"col1\", \"col2\", ...] are case sensitive and should be a list of strings containing unique values that are a subset of the column names in the input data. The list of columns provided must not include the target column. AlgorithmsConfig (list) --- Stores the configuration information for the selection of algorithms trained on tabular data. The list of available algorithms to choose from depends on the training mode set in TabularJobConfig.Mode. AlgorithmsConfig should not be set if the training mode is set on AUTO. When AlgorithmsConfig is provided, one AutoMLAlgorithms attribute must be set and one only. If the list of algorithms provided as values for AutoMLAlgorithms is empty, CandidateGenerationConfig uses the full set of algorithms for the given training mode. When AlgorithmsConfig is not provided, CandidateGenerationConfig uses the full set of algorithms for the given training mode. For the list of all algorithms per problem type and training mode, see AutoMLAlgorithmConfig. For more information on each algorithm, see the Algorithm support section in Autopilot developer guide. (dict) --- The selection of algorithms trained on your dataset to generate the model candidates for an Autopilot job. The selection of algorithms trained on your dataset to generate the model candidates for an Autopilot job. For the tabular problem type TabularJobConfig: For the time-series forecasting problem type TimeSeriesForecastingJobConfig: Choose your algorithms from this list. 'cnn-qr' 'deepar' 'prophet' 'arima' 'npts' 'ets' (string) --- DataSplitConfig (dict) --- The configuration for splitting the input training dataset. Type: AutoMLDataSplitConfig ValidationFraction (float) --- The validation fraction (optional) is a float that specifies the portion of the training dataset to be used for validation. The default value is 0.2, and values must be greater than 0 and less than 1. We recommend setting this value to be less than 0.5. Mode (string) --- The method that Autopilot uses to train the data. You can either specify the mode manually or let Autopilot choose for you based on the dataset size by selecting AUTO. In AUTO mode, Autopilot chooses ENSEMBLING for datasets smaller than 100 MB, and HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING for larger ones. The ENSEMBLING mode uses a multi-stack ensemble model to predict classification and regression tasks directly from your dataset. This machine learning mode combines several base models to produce an optimal predictive model. It then uses a stacking ensemble method to combine predictions from contributing members. A multi-stack ensemble model can provide better performance over a single model by combining the predictive capabilities of multiple models. See Autopilot algorithm support for a list of algorithms supported by ENSEMBLING mode. The HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING (HPO) mode uses the best hyperparameters to train the best version of a model. HPO automatically selects an algorithm for the type of problem you want to solve. Then HPO finds the best hyperparameters according to your objective metric. See Autopilot algorithm support for a list of algorithms supported by HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING mode.",

In AUTO mode, Autopilot chooses ENSEMBLING for datasets smaller than 100 MB, and HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING for larger ones. The ENSEMBLING mode uses a multi-stack ensemble model to predict classification and regression tasks directly from your dataset. This machine learning mode combines several base models to produce an optimal predictive model. It then uses a stacking ensemble method to combine predictions from contributing members. A multi-stack ensemble model can provide better performance over a single model by combining the predictive capabilities of multiple models. See Autopilot algorithm support for a list of algorithms supported by ENSEMBLING mode. The HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING (HPO) mode uses the best hyperparameters to train the best version of a model. HPO automatically selects an algorithm for the type of problem you want to solve. Then HPO finds the best hyperparameters according to your objective metric.
