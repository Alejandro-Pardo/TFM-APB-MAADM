  "description": "Terminates the ML compute instance. Before terminating the instance, SageMaker AI disconnects the ML storage volume from it. SageMaker AI preserves the ML storage volume. SageMaker AI stops charging you for the ML compute instance when you call StopNotebookInstance. To access data on the ML storage volume for a notebook instance that has been terminated, call the StartNotebookInstance API. StartNotebookInstance launches another ML compute instance, configures it, and attaches the preserved ML storage volume so you can continue your work.",
