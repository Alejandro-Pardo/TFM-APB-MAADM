  "description": "Gets a list of aliases in the caller's Amazon Web Services account and region. For more information about aliases, see  CreateAlias. By default, the ListAliases operation returns all aliases in the account and region. To get only the aliases associated with a particular KMS key, use the KeyId parameter. The ListAliases response can include aliases that you created and associated with your customer managed keys, and aliases that Amazon Web Services created and associated with Amazon Web Services managed keys in your account. You can recognize Amazon Web Services aliases because their names have the format aws/<service-name>, such as aws/dynamodb. The response might also include aliases that have no TargetKeyId field. These are predefined aliases that Amazon Web Services has created but has not yet associated with a KMS key. Aliases that Amazon Web Services creates in your account, including predefined aliases, do not count against your KMS aliases quota. Cross-account use: No. ListAliases does not return aliases in other Amazon Web Services accounts. Required permissions: kms:ListAliases (IAM policy) For details, see Controlling access to aliases in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",
