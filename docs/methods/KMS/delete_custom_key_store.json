  "description": "Deletes a custom key store. This operation does not affect any backing elements of the custom key store. It does not delete the CloudHSM cluster that is associated with an CloudHSM key store, or affect any users or keys in the cluster. For an external key store, it does not affect the external key store proxy, external key manager, or any external keys. This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage. The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any KMS keys. Before deleting the key store, verify that you will never need to use any of the KMS keys in the key store for any cryptographic operations. Then, use  ScheduleKeyDeletion to delete the KMS keys from the key store. After the required waiting period expires and all KMS keys are deleted from the custom key store, use  DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect the key store from KMS. Then, you can delete the custom key store. For keys in an CloudHSM key store, the ScheduleKeyDeletion operation makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated cluster. However, you might need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups. KMS never creates, manages, or deletes cryptographic keys in the external key manager associated with an external key store. You must manage them using your external key manager tools. Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using the  DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store from its backing key store. While the key store is disconnected, you cannot create or use the KMS keys in the key store. But, you do not need to delete KMS keys and you can reconnect a disconnected custom key store at any time. If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties. Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account. Required permissions: kms:DeleteCustomKeyStore (IAM policy) Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",
