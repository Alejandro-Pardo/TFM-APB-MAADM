  "description": "Adds a grant to a KMS key. A grant is a policy instrument that allows Amazon Web Services principals to use KMS keys in cryptographic operations. It also can allow them to view a KMS key (  DescribeKey) and create and manage grants. When authorizing access to a KMS key, grants are considered along with key policies and IAM policies. Grants are often used for temporary permissions because you can create one, use its permissions, and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies. For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see Grants in KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide . For examples of working with grants in several programming languages, see Programming grants. The CreateGrant operation returns a GrantToken and a GrantId. The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter. Required permissions: kms:CreateGrant (key policy) Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",

KMS supports the EncryptionContextEquals and EncryptionContextSubset grant constraints, which allow the permissions in the grant only when the encryption context in the request matches ( EncryptionContextEquals) or includes ( EncryptionContextSubset) the encryption context specified in the constraint. The encryption context grant constraints are supported only on grant operations that include an EncryptionContext parameter, such as cryptographic operations on symmetric encryption KMS keys. Grants with grant constraints can include the  DescribeKey and  RetireGrant operations, but the constraint doesn't apply to these operations. If a grant with a grant constraint includes the CreateGrant operation, the constraint requires that any grants created with the CreateGrant permission have an equally strict or stricter encryption context constraint. You cannot use an encryption context grant constraint for cryptographic operations with asymmetric KMS keys or HMAC KMS keys. Operations with these keys don't support an encryption context. Each constraint value can include up to 8 encryption context pairs. The encryption context value in each constraint cannot exceed 384 characters.
