  "description": "Returns the public key and an import token you need to import or reimport key material for a KMS key. By default, KMS keys are created with key material that KMS generates. This operation supports Importing key material, an advanced feature that lets you generate and import the cryptographic key material for a KMS key. For more information about importing key material into KMS, see Importing key material in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Before calling GetParametersForImport, use the  CreateKey operation with an Origin value of EXTERNAL to create a KMS key with no key material. You can import key material for a symmetric encryption KMS key, HMAC KMS key, asymmetric encryption KMS key, or asymmetric signing KMS key. You can also import key material into a multi-Region key of any supported type. However, you can't import key material into a KMS key in a custom key store. You can also use GetParametersForImport to get a public key and import token to reimport the original key material into a KMS key whose key material expired or was deleted. GetParametersForImport returns the items that you need to import your key material. The public key and its import token are permanently linked and must be used together. Each public key and import token set is valid for 24 hours. The expiration date and time appear in the ParametersValidTo field in the GetParametersForImport response. You cannot use an expired public key or import token in an  ImportKeyMaterial request. If your key and token expire, send another GetParametersForImport request. GetParametersForImport requires the following information: You can use the same or a different public key spec and wrapping algorithm each time you import or reimport the same key material. The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account. Required permissions: kms:GetParametersForImport (key policy) Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",

For more information, see Select a wrapping algorithm in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. For RSA_AES wrapping algorithms, you encrypt your key material with an AES key that you generate, then encrypt your AES key with the RSA public key from KMS. For RSAES wrapping algorithms, you encrypt your key material directly with the RSA public key from KMS. The wrapping algorithms that you can use depend on the type of key material that you are importing. To import an RSA private key, you must use an RSA_AES wrapping algorithm. RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_256 --\u0094 Supported for wrapping RSA and ECC key material. RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP_SHA_1 --\u0094 Supported for wrapping RSA and ECC key material. RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256 --\u0094 Supported for all types of key material, except RSA key material (private key).
