  "description": "Deletes tags from a customer managed key. To delete a tag, specify the tag key and the KMS key. When it succeeds, the UntagResource operation doesn't return any output. Also, if the specified tag key isn't found on the KMS key, it doesn't throw an exception or return a response. To confirm that the operation worked, use the  ListResourceTags operation. For information about using tags in KMS, see Tagging keys. For general information about tags, including the format and syntax, see Tagging Amazon Web Services resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account. Required permissions: kms:UntagResource (key policy) Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",
