  "description": "Changes the properties of a custom key store. You can use this operation to change the properties of an CloudHSM key store or an external key store. Use the required CustomKeyStoreId parameter to identify the custom key store. Use the remaining optional parameters to change its properties. This operation does not return any property values. To verify the updated property values, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage. For an CloudHSM key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store friendly name ( NewCustomKeyStoreName), to tell KMS about a change to the kmsuser crypto user password ( KeyStorePassword), or to associate the custom key store with a different, but related, CloudHSM cluster ( CloudHsmClusterId). To update any property of an CloudHSM key store, the ConnectionState of the CloudHSM key store must be DISCONNECTED. For an external key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store friendly name ( NewCustomKeyStoreName), or to tell KMS about a change to the external key store proxy authentication credentials ( XksProxyAuthenticationCredential), connection method ( XksProxyConnectivity), external proxy endpoint ( XksProxyUriEndpoint) and path ( XksProxyUriPath). For external key stores with an XksProxyConnectivity of VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE, you can also update the Amazon VPC endpoint service name ( XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName). To update most properties of an external key store, the ConnectionState of the external key store must be DISCONNECTED. However, you can update the CustomKeyStoreName, XksProxyAuthenticationCredential, and XksProxyUriPath of an external key store when it is in the CONNECTED or DISCONNECTED state. If your update requires a DISCONNECTED state, before using UpdateCustomKeyStore, use the  DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store. After the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation completes, use the  ConnectCustomKeyStore to reconnect the custom key store. To find the ConnectionState of the custom key store, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. Before updating the custom key store, verify that the new values allow KMS to connect the custom key store to its backing key store. For example, before you change the XksProxyUriPath value, verify that the external key store proxy is reachable at the new path. If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties. Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account. Required permissions: kms:UpdateCustomKeyStore (IAM policy) Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",
