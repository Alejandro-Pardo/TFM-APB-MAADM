  "description": "Associates an existing KMS alias with a different KMS key. Each alias is associated with only one KMS key at a time, although a KMS key can have multiple aliases. The alias and the KMS key must be in the same Amazon Web Services account and Region. The current and new KMS key must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric or both HMAC), and they must have the same key usage. This restriction prevents errors in code that uses aliases. If you must assign an alias to a different type of KMS key, use  DeleteAlias to delete the old alias and  CreateAlias to create a new alias. You cannot use UpdateAlias to change an alias name. To change an alias name, use  DeleteAlias to delete the old alias and  CreateAlias to create a new alias. Because an alias is not a property of a KMS key, you can create, update, and delete the aliases of a KMS key without affecting the KMS key. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the  DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all KMS keys in the account, use the  ListAliases operation. The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account. For details, see Controlling access to aliases in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",
