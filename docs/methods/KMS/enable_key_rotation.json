  "description": "Enables automatic rotation of the key material of the specified symmetric encryption KMS key. By default, when you enable automatic rotation of a customer managed KMS key, KMS rotates the key material of the KMS key one year (approximately 365 days) from the enable date and every year thereafter. You can use the optional RotationPeriodInDays parameter to specify a custom rotation period when you enable key rotation, or you can use RotationPeriodInDays to modify the rotation period of a key that you previously enabled automatic key rotation on. You can monitor rotation of the key material for your KMS keys in CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch. To disable rotation of the key material in a customer managed KMS key, use the  DisableKeyRotation operation. You can use the  GetKeyRotationStatus operation to identify any in progress rotations. You can use the  ListKeyRotations operation to view the details of completed rotations. Automatic key rotation is supported only on symmetric encryption KMS keys. You cannot enable automatic rotation of asymmetric KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, KMS keys with imported key material, or KMS keys in a custom key store. To enable or disable automatic rotation of a set of related multi-Region keys, set the property on the primary key. You cannot enable or disable automatic rotation of Amazon Web Services managed KMS keys. KMS always rotates the key material of Amazon Web Services managed keys every year. Rotation of Amazon Web Services owned KMS keys is managed by the Amazon Web Services service that owns the key. The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account. Required permissions: kms:EnableKeyRotation (key policy) Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",
