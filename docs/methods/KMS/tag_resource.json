  "description": "Adds or edits tags on a customer managed key. Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value, both of which are case-sensitive strings. The tag value can be an empty (null) string. To add a tag, specify a new tag key and a tag value. To edit a tag, specify an existing tag key and a new tag value. You can use this operation to tag a customer managed key, but you cannot tag an Amazon Web Services managed key, an Amazon Web Services owned key, a custom key store, or an alias. You can also add tags to a KMS key while creating it (  CreateKey) or replicating it (  ReplicateKey). For information about using tags in KMS, see Tagging keys. For general information about tags, including the format and syntax, see Tagging Amazon Web Services resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account. Required permissions: kms:TagResource (key policy) Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",
