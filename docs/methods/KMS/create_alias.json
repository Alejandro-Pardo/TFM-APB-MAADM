  "description": "Creates a friendly name for a KMS key. You can use an alias to identify a KMS key in the KMS console, in the  DescribeKey operation and in cryptographic operations, such as  Encrypt and  GenerateDataKey. You can also change the KMS key that's associated with the alias (  UpdateAlias) or delete the alias (  DeleteAlias) at any time. These operations don't affect the underlying KMS key. You can associate the alias with any customer managed key in the same Amazon Web Services Region. Each alias is associated with only one KMS key at a time, but a KMS key can have multiple aliases. A valid KMS key is required. You can't create an alias without a KMS key. The alias must be unique in the account and Region, but you can have aliases with the same name in different Regions. For detailed information about aliases, see Using aliases in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. This operation does not return a response. To get the alias that you created, use the  ListAliases operation. The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different Amazon Web Services account. For details, see Controlling access to aliases in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",
