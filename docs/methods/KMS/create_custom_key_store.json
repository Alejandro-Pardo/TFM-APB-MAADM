  "description": "Creates a custom key store backed by a key store that you own and manage. When you use a KMS key in a custom key store for a cryptographic operation, the cryptographic operation is actually performed in your key store using your keys. KMS supports CloudHSM key stores backed by an CloudHSM cluster and external key stores backed by an external key store proxy and external key manager outside of Amazon Web Services. This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage. Before you create the custom key store, the required elements must be in place and operational. We recommend that you use the test tools that KMS provides to verify the configuration your external key store proxy. For details about the required elements and verification tests, see Assemble the prerequisites (for CloudHSM key stores) or Assemble the prerequisites (for external key stores) in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. To create a custom key store, use the following parameters. When the operation completes successfully, it returns the ID of the new custom key store. Before you can use your new custom key store, you need to use the  ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to connect a new CloudHSM key store to its CloudHSM cluster, or to connect a new external key store to the external key store proxy for your external key manager. Even if you are not going to use your custom key store immediately, you might want to connect it to verify that all settings are correct and then disconnect it until you are ready to use it. For help with failures, see Troubleshooting a custom key store in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account. Required permissions: kms:CreateCustomKeyStore (IAM policy). Eventual consistency: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency.",

For help making this choice, see Choosing a connectivity option in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. An Amazon VPC endpoint service keeps your communication with KMS in a private address space entirely within Amazon Web Services, but it requires more configuration, including establishing a Amazon VPC with multiple subnets, a VPC endpoint service, a network load balancer, and a verified private DNS name. A public endpoint is simpler to set up, but it might be slower and might not fulfill your security requirements. You might consider testing with a public endpoint, and then establishing a VPC endpoint service for production tasks. Note that this choice does not determine the location of the external key store proxy. Even if you choose a VPC endpoint service, the proxy can be hosted within the VPC or outside of Amazon Web Services such as in your corporate data center.",
