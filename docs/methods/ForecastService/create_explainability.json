  "description": "Creates an Amazon Forecast Explainability. Explainability helps you better understand how the attributes in your datasets impact forecast. Amazon Forecast uses a metric called Impact scores to quantify the relative impact of each attribute and determine whether they increase or decrease forecast values. To enable Forecast Explainability, your predictor must include at least one of the following: related time series, item metadata, or additional datasets like Holidays and the Weather Index. CreateExplainability accepts either a Predictor ARN or Forecast ARN. To receive aggregated Impact scores for all time series and time points in your datasets, provide a Predictor ARN. To receive Impact scores for specific time series and time points, provide a Forecast ARN. The following parameters are required when providing a Predictor ARN: Do not specify a value for the following parameters: The following parameters are required when providing a Predictor ARN: If you set TimeSeriesGranularity to 'SPECIFIC', you must also provide the following: If you set TimePointGranularity to 'SPECIFIC', you must also provide the following:",
