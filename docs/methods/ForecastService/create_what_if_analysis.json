  "description": "What-if analysis is a scenario modeling technique where you make a hypothetical change to a time series and compare the forecasts generated by these changes against the baseline, unchanged time series. It is important to remember that the purpose of a what-if analysis is to understand how a forecast can change given different modifications to the baseline time series. For example, imagine you are a clothing retailer who is considering an end of season sale to clear space for new styles. After creating a baseline forecast, you can use a what-if analysis to investigate how different sales tactics might affect your goals. You could create a scenario where everything is given a 25% markdown, and another where everything is given a fixed dollar markdown. You could create a scenario where the sale lasts for one week and another where the sale lasts for one month. With a what-if analysis, you can compare many different scenarios against each other. Note that a what-if analysis is meant to display what the forecasting model has learned and how it will behave in the scenarios that you are evaluating. Do not blindly use the results of the what-if analysis to make business decisions. For instance, forecasts might not be accurate for novel scenarios where there is no reference available to determine whether a forecast is good. The  TimeSeriesSelector object defines the items that you want in the what-if analysis.",

Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. The following basic restrictions apply to tags: Maximum number of tags per resource - 50. For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value. Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8. Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8. If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values are case sensitive. Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit. One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag.
