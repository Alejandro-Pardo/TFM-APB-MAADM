  "description": "Creates an Amazon Forecast predictor. In the request, provide a dataset group and either specify an algorithm or let Amazon Forecast choose an algorithm for you using AutoML. If you specify an algorithm, you also can override algorithm-specific hyperparameters. Amazon Forecast uses the algorithm to train a predictor using the latest version of the datasets in the specified dataset group. You can then generate a forecast using the  CreateForecast operation. To see the evaluation metrics, use the  GetAccuracyMetrics operation. You can specify a featurization configuration to fill and aggregate the data fields in the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset to improve model training. For more information, see  FeaturizationConfig. For RELATED_TIME_SERIES datasets, CreatePredictor verifies that the DataFrequency specified when the dataset was created matches the ForecastFrequency. TARGET_TIME_SERIES datasets don't have this restriction. Amazon Forecast also verifies the delimiter and timestamp format. For more information, see  howitworks-datasets-groups. By default, predictors are trained and evaluated at the 0.1 (P10), 0.5 (P50), and 0.9 (P90) quantiles. You can choose custom forecast types to train and evaluate your predictor by setting the ForecastTypes. If you want Amazon Forecast to evaluate each algorithm and choose the one that minimizes the objective function, set PerformAutoML to true. The objective function is defined as the mean of the weighted losses over the forecast types. By default, these are the p10, p50, and p90 quantile losses. For more information, see  EvaluationResult. When AutoML is enabled, the following properties are disallowed: To get a list of all of your predictors, use the  ListPredictors operation.",
