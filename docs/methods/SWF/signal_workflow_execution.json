  "description": "Records a WorkflowExecutionSignaled event in the workflow execution history and creates a decision task for the workflow execution identified by the given domain, workflowId and runId. The event is recorded with the specified user defined signalName and input (if provided). You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows: If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.",
