  "description": "Deprecates the specified activity type. After an activity type has been deprecated, you cannot create new tasks of that activity type. Tasks of this type that were scheduled before the type was deprecated continue to run. You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows: If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.",
