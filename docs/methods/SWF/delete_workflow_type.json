  "description": "Deletes the specified workflow type. Note: Prior to deletion, workflow types must first be deprecated. After a workflow type has been deleted, you cannot create new executions of that type. Executions that started before the type was deleted will continue to run. You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows: If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.",
