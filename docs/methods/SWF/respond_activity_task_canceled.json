  "description": "Used by workers to tell the service that the  ActivityTask identified by the taskToken was successfully canceled. Additional details can be provided using the details argument. These details (if provided) appear in the ActivityTaskCanceled event added to the workflow history. A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled until it is closed. Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is processing it. A task is closed after it has been specified in a call to  RespondActivityTaskCompleted, RespondActivityTaskCanceled,  RespondActivityTaskFailed, or the task has timed out. You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows: If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.",
