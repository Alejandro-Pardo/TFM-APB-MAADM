  "description": "Returns the estimated number of activity tasks in the specified task list. The count returned is an approximation and isn't guaranteed to be exact. If you specify a task list that no activity task was ever scheduled in then 0 is returned. You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows: If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.",
