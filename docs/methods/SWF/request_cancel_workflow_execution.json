  "description": "Records a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in the currently running workflow execution identified by the given domain, workflowId, and runId. This logically requests the cancellation of the workflow execution as a whole. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event. You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows: If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.",
