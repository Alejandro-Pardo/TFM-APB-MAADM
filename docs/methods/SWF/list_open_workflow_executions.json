To retrieve subsequent pages, make the call again using the nextPageToken returned by the initial call.

The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.",
