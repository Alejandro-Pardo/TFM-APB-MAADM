Event destinations are places that you can send information about these events to. For example, you can send event data to Amazon SNS to receive notifications when you receive bounces or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.",

MatchingEventTypes (list) --- An array that specifies which events Amazon Pinpoint should send to the destinations in this EventDestinationDefinition. (string) --- An email sending event type. For example, email sends, opens, and bounces are all email events. KinesisFirehoseDestination (dict) --- An object that defines an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose destination for email events. You can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream data to other services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift.

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose stream that Amazon Pinpoint sends email events to.

The location where Amazon Pinpoint finds the value of a dimension to publish to Amazon CloudWatch. If you want Amazon Pinpoint to use the message tags that you specify using an X-SES-MESSAGE-TAGS header or a parameter to the SendEmail/SendRawEmail API, choose messageTag.

This value has to meet the following criteria: It can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).
