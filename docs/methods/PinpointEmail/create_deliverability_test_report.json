  "description": "Create a new predictive inbox placement test. Predictive inbox placement tests can help you predict how your messages will be handled by various email providers around the world. When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers. Amazon Pinpoint then sends that message to special email addresses spread across several major email providers. After about 24 hours, the test is complete, and you can use the GetDeliverabilityTestReport operation to view the results of the test.",

      "description": "The HTML body of the message that you sent when you performed the predictive inbox placement test. Simple (dict) --- The simple email message. The message consists of a subject and a message body. The subject line of the email. The subject line can only contain 7-bit ASCII characters. However, you can specify non-ASCII characters in the subject line by using encoded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047. The content of the message itself. Charset (string) --- The character set for the content. Because of the constraints of the SMTP protocol, Amazon Pinpoint uses 7-bit ASCII by default. If the text includes characters outside of the ASCII range, you have to specify a character set. For example, you could specify UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, or Shift_JIS. The body of the message. You can specify an HTML version of the message, a text-only version of the message, or both. Text (dict) --- An object that represents the version of the message that is displayed in email clients that don't support HTML, or clients where the recipient has disabled HTML rendering. Html (dict) --- An object that represents the version of the message that is displayed in email clients that support HTML. HTML messages can include formatted text, hyperlinks, images, and more. Raw (dict) --- The raw email message. The message has to meet the following criteria: The message has to contain a header and a body, separated by one blank line. All of the required header fields must be present in the message. Each part of a multipart MIME message must be formatted properly. If you include attachments, they must be in a file format that Amazon Pinpoint supports. The entire message must be Base64 encoded. If any of the MIME parts in your message contain content that is outside of the 7-bit ASCII character range, you should encode that content to ensure that recipients' email clients render the message properly. The length of any single line of text in the message can't exceed 1,000 characters. This restriction is defined in RFC 5321. The raw email message. Attachments must be in a file format that Amazon Pinpoint supports. Template (dict) --- The template to use for the email message. TemplateArn (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the template. TemplateData (string) --- An object that defines the values to use for message variables in the template. This object is a set of key-value pairs. Each key defines a message variable in the template. The corresponding value defines the value to use for that variable.",
