You can't change the sink or change the monitoring account with this operation.

To update the list of tags associated with the sink, use TagResource.",

LogGroupConfiguration (dict) --- Use this structure to filter which log groups are to send log events from the source account to the monitoring account. Use this field to specify which log groups are to share their log events with the monitoring account. Use the term LogGroupName and one or more of the following operands. Use single quotation marks (') around log group names. The matching of log group names is case sensitive. Each filter has a limit of five conditional operands. Conditional operands are AND and OR. = and != AND OR LIKE and NOT LIKE. These can be used only as prefix searches. Include a % at the end of the string that you want to search for and include. IN and NOT IN, using parentheses ( ) Examples: LogGroupName IN ('This-Log-Group', 'Other-Log-Group') includes only the log groups with names This-Log-Group and Other-Log-Group. LogGroupName NOT IN ('Private-Log-Group', 'Private-Log-Group-2') includes all log groups except the log groups with names Private-Log-Group and Private-Log-Group-2. LogGroupName LIKE 'aws/lambda/%' OR LogGroupName LIKE 'AWSLogs%' includes all log groups that have names that start with aws/lambda/ or AWSLogs.

Use this field to specify which metrics are to be shared with the monitoring account. Use the term Namespace and one or more of the following operands. Use single quotation marks (') around namespace names. The matching of namespace names is case sensitive. IN and NOT IN, using parentheses ( ) Examples: Namespace NOT LIKE 'AWS/%' includes only namespaces that don't start with AWS/, such as custom namespaces. Namespace IN ('AWS/EC2', 'AWS/ELB', 'AWS/S3') includes only the metrics in the EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon S3 namespaces.
