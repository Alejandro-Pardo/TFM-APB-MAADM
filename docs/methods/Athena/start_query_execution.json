This affects the query results location. The workgroup settings override is specified in EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration (true/false) in the WorkGroupConfiguration. See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration. OutputLocation (string) --- The location in Amazon S3 where your query and calculation results are stored, such as s3://path/to/query/bucket/. To run the query, you must specify the query results location using one of the ways: either for individual queries using either this setting (client-side), or in the workgroup, using  WorkGroupConfiguration. If none of them is set, Athena issues an error that no output location is provided. If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses the settings specified for the workgroup. EncryptionConfiguration (dict) --- If query and calculation results are encrypted in Amazon S3, indicates the encryption option used (for example, SSE_KMS or CSE_KMS) and key information. This is a client-side setting. If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses the encryption configuration that is specified for the workgroup, and also uses the location for storing query results specified in the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration and Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Settings. Indicates whether Amazon S3 server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys ( SSE_S3), server-side encryption with KMS-managed keys ( SSE_KMS), or client-side encryption with KMS-managed keys ( CSE_KMS) is used. If a query runs in a workgroup and the workgroup overrides client-side settings, then the workgroup's setting for encryption is used. It specifies whether query results must be encrypted, for all queries that run in this workgroup. KmsKey (string) --- For SSE_KMS and CSE_KMS, this is the KMS key ARN or ID. ExpectedBucketOwner (string) --- The Amazon Web Services account ID that you expect to be the owner of the Amazon S3 bucket specified by  ResultConfiguration$OutputLocation. If set, Athena uses the value for ExpectedBucketOwner when it makes Amazon S3 calls to your specified output location. If the ExpectedBucketOwner Amazon Web Services account ID does not match the actual owner of the Amazon S3 bucket, the call fails with a permissions error. If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses the ExpectedBucketOwner setting that is specified for the workgroup, and also uses the location for storing query results specified in the workgroup. AclConfiguration (dict) --- Indicates that an Amazon S3 canned ACL should be set to control ownership of stored query results. Currently the only supported canned ACL is BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL. If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses the ACL configuration that is specified for the workgroup, and also uses the location for storing query results specified in the workgroup.
