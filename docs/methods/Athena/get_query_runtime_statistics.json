  "description": "Returns query execution runtime statistics related to a single execution of a query if you have access to the workgroup in which the query ran. Statistics from the Timeline section of the response object are available as soon as  QueryExecutionStatus$State is in a SUCCEEDED or FAILED state. The remaining non-timeline statistics in the response (like stage-level input and output row count and data size) are updated asynchronously and may not be available immediately after a query completes. The non-timeline statistics are also not included when a query has row-level filters defined in Lake Formation.",
