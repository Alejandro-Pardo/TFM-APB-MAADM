  "description": "When you attach a resource-based policy to a resource, RAM automatically creates a resource share of featureSet``= ``CREATED_FROM_POLICY with a managed permission that has the same IAM permissions as the original resource-based policy. However, this type of managed permission is visible to only the resource share owner, and the associated resource share can't be modified by using RAM. This operation promotes the resource share to a STANDARD resource share that is fully manageable in RAM. When you promote a resource share, you can then manage the resource share in RAM and it becomes visible to all of the principals you shared it with.",
