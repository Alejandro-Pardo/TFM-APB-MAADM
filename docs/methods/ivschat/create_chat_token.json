  "description": "Creates an encrypted token that is used by a chat participant to establish an individual WebSocket chat connection to a room. When the token is used to connect to chat, the connection is valid for the session duration specified in the request. The token becomes invalid at the token-expiration timestamp included in the response. Use the capabilities field to permit an end user to send messages or moderate a room. The attributes field securely attaches structured data to the chat session; the data is included within each message sent by the end user and received by other participants in the room. Common use cases for attributes include passing end-user profile data like an icon, display name, colors, badges, and other display features. Encryption keys are owned by Amazon IVS Chat and never used directly by your application.",
