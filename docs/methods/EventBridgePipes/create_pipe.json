      "description": "The parameters required to set up a source for your pipe. FilterCriteria (dict) --- The collection of event patterns used to filter events. To remove a filter, specify a FilterCriteria object with an empty array of Filter objects. For more information, see Events and Event Patterns in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide. Filters (list) --- The event patterns. (dict) --- Filter events using an event pattern. Pattern (string) --- The event pattern. KinesisStreamParameters (dict) --- The parameters for using a Kinesis stream as a source. BatchSize (integer) --- The maximum number of records to include in each batch. DeadLetterConfig (dict) --- Define the target queue to send dead-letter queue events to. Arn (string) --- The ARN of the specified target for the dead-letter queue. For Amazon Kinesis stream and Amazon DynamoDB stream sources, specify either an Amazon SNS topic or Amazon SQS queue ARN. OnPartialBatchItemFailure (string) --- Define how to handle item process failures. AUTOMATIC_BISECT halves each batch and retry each half until all the records are processed or there is one failed message left in the batch. MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds (integer) --- The maximum length of a time to wait for events. MaximumRecordAgeInSeconds (integer) --- Discard records older than the specified age. The default value is -1, which sets the maximum age to infinite. When the value is set to infinite, EventBridge never discards old records. MaximumRetryAttempts (integer) --- Discard records after the specified number of retries. The default value is -1, which sets the maximum number of retries to infinite. When MaximumRetryAttempts is infinite, EventBridge retries failed records until the record expires in the event source. ParallelizationFactor (integer) --- The number of batches to process concurrently from each shard. The default value is 1. The position in a stream from which to start reading. StartingPositionTimestamp (datetime) --- With StartingPosition set to AT_TIMESTAMP, the time from which to start reading, in Unix time seconds. DynamoDBStreamParameters (dict) --- The parameters for using a DynamoDB stream as a source. SqsQueueParameters (dict) --- The parameters for using a Amazon SQS stream as a source. ActiveMQBrokerParameters (dict) --- The parameters for using an Active MQ broker as a source. The credentials needed to access the resource. BasicAuth (string) --- The ARN of the Secrets Manager secret. The name of the destination queue to consume. RabbitMQBrokerParameters (dict) --- The parameters for using a Rabbit MQ broker as a source. VirtualHost (string) --- The name of the virtual host associated with the source broker. ManagedStreamingKafkaParameters (dict) --- The parameters for using an MSK stream as a source. The name of the topic that the pipe will read from. StartingPosition (string) --- The position in a stream from which to start reading. ConsumerGroupID (string) --- The name of the destination queue to consume. Credentials (dict) --- The credentials needed to access the resource. SaslScram512Auth (string) --- The ARN of the Secrets Manager secret. ClientCertificateTlsAuth (string) --- The ARN of the Secrets Manager secret. SelfManagedKafkaParameters (dict) --- The parameters for using a self-managed Apache Kafka stream as a source. A self managed cluster refers to any Apache Kafka cluster not hosted by Amazon Web Services. This includes both clusters you manage yourself, as well as those hosted by a third-party provider, such as Confluent Cloud, CloudKarafka, or Redpanda. For more information, see Apache Kafka streams as a source in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide. AdditionalBootstrapServers (list) --- An array of server URLs. (string) --- BatchSize (integer) --- The maximum number of records to include in each batch. SaslScram256Auth (string) --- The ARN of the Secrets Manager secret. ServerRootCaCertificate (string) --- The ARN of the Secrets Manager secret used for certification. Vpc (dict) --- This structure specifies the VPC subnets and security groups for the stream, and whether a public IP address is to be used. Subnets (list) --- Specifies the subnets associated with the stream. These subnets must all be in the same VPC. You can specify as many as 16 subnets. (string) --- SecurityGroup (list) --- Specifies the security groups associated with the stream. These security groups must all be in the same VPC. You can specify as many as five security groups.

KinesisStreamParameters (dict) --- The parameters for using a Kinesis stream as a target. Determines which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. Partition keys are Unicode strings with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams uses the partition key as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. Specifically, an MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same shard within the stream. EcsTaskParameters (dict) --- The parameters for using an Amazon ECS task as a target. The ARN of the task definition to use if the event target is an Amazon ECS task.

NetworkConfiguration (dict) --- Use this structure if the Amazon ECS task uses the awsvpc network mode. This structure specifies the VPC subnets and security groups associated with the task, and whether a public IP address is to be used. This structure is required if LaunchType is FARGATE because the awsvpc mode is required for Fargate tasks. If you specify NetworkConfiguration when the target ECS task does not use the awsvpc network mode, the task fails. awsvpcConfiguration (dict) --- Use this structure to specify the VPC subnets and security groups for the task, and whether a public IP address is to be used. This structure is relevant only for ECS tasks that use the awsvpc network mode. Specifies the subnets associated with the task. These subnets must all be in the same VPC. You can specify as many as 16 subnets. (string) --- SecurityGroups (list) --- Specifies the security groups associated with the task. These security groups must all be in the same VPC. You can specify as many as five security groups. If you do not specify a security group, the default security group for the VPC is used.

The weight value is taken into consideration after the base value, if defined, is satisfied. base (integer) --- The base value designates how many tasks, at a minimum, to run on the specified capacity provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity provider strategy can have a base defined. If no value is specified, the default value of 0 is used. EnableECSManagedTags (boolean) --- Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags for the task. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. EnableExecuteCommand (boolean) --- Whether or not to enable the execute command functionality for the containers in this task.

(dict) --- The task placement strategy for a task or service. To learn more, see Task Placement Strategies in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Service Developer Guide. type (string) --- The type of placement strategy. The random placement strategy randomly places tasks on available candidates. The spread placement strategy spreads placement across available candidates evenly based on the field parameter. The binpack strategy places tasks on available candidates that have the least available amount of the resource that is specified with the field parameter. For example, if you binpack on memory, a task is placed on the instance with the least amount of remaining memory (but still enough to run the task). field (string) --- The field to apply the placement strategy against. For the spread placement strategy, valid values are instanceId (or host, which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to a container instance, such as attribute:ecs.availability-zone. For the binpack placement strategy, valid values are cpu and memory. For the random placement strategy, this field is not used. PropagateTags (string) --- Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition to the task. If no value is specified, the tags are not propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the task during task creation. To add tags to a task after task creation, use the TagResource API action. ReferenceId (string) --- The reference ID to use for the task. Overrides (dict) --- The overrides that are associated with a task. ContainerOverrides (list) --- One or more container overrides that are sent to a task. (dict) --- The overrides that are sent to a container. An empty container override can be passed in. An example of an empty container override is {\"containerOverrides\": [ ] }. If a non-empty container override is specified, the name parameter must be included. Command (list) --- The command to send to the container that overrides the default command from the Docker image or the task definition. You must also specify a container name. (string) --- Cpu (integer) --- The number of cpu units reserved for the container, instead of the default value from the task definition. Environment (list) --- The environment variables to send to the container.

(dict) --- The environment variables to send to the container. name (string) --- The name of the key-value pair. For environment variables, this is the name of the environment variable. value (string) --- The value of the key-value pair. For environment variables, this is the value of the environment variable. EnvironmentFiles (list) --- A list of files containing the environment variables to pass to a container, instead of the value from the container definition. (dict) --- A list of files containing the environment variables to pass to a container. You can specify up to ten environment files. The file must have a .env file extension. Each line in an environment file should contain an environment variable in VARIABLE=VALUE format. Lines beginning with # are treated as comments and are ignored. For more information about the environment variable file syntax, see Declare default environment variables in file. If there are environment variables specified using the environment parameter in a container definition, they take precedence over the variables contained within an environment file. If multiple environment files are specified that contain the same variable, they're processed from the top down. We recommend that you use unique variable names. For more information, see Specifying environment variables in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. This parameter is only supported for tasks hosted on Fargate using the following platform versions: Linux platform version 1.4.0 or later. Windows platform version 1.0.0 or later.
