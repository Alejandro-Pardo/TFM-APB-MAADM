Changing the pipeline status is useful if you want to cancel one or more jobs. You can't cancel jobs after Elastic Transcoder has started processing them; if you pause the pipeline to which you submitted the jobs, you have more time to get the job IDs for the jobs that you want to cancel, and to send a  CancelJob request.",
