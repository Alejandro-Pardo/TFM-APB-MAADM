  "description": "Terminates the specified WorkSpaces. You can terminate a WorkSpace that is in any state except SUSPENDED. This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpaces have been completely terminated. After a WorkSpace is terminated, the TERMINATED state is returned only briefly before the WorkSpace directory metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned. To confirm that a WorkSpace is terminated, check for the WorkSpace ID by using DescribeWorkSpaces. If the WorkSpace ID isn't returned, then the WorkSpace has been successfully terminated.",
