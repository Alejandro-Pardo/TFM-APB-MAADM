  "description": "Associates a VPC with a service network. When you associate a VPC with the service network, it enables all the resources within that VPC to be clients and communicate with other services in the service network. For more information, see Manage VPC associations in the Amazon VPC Lattice User Guide. You can't use this operation if there is a disassociation in progress. If the association fails, retry by deleting the association and recreating it. As a result of this operation, the association gets created in the service network account and the VPC owner account. If you add a security group to the service network and VPC association, the association must continue to always have at least one security group. You can add or edit security groups at any time. However, to remove all security groups, you must first delete the association and recreate it without security groups.",
