  "description": "Associates the specified service with the specified service network. For more information, see Manage service associations in the Amazon VPC Lattice User Guide. You can't use this operation if the service and service network are already associated or if there is a disassociation or deletion in progress. If the association fails, you can retry the operation by deleting the association and recreating it. You cannot associate a service and service network that are shared with a caller. The caller must own either the service or the service network. As a result of this operation, the association is created in the service network account and the association owner account.",
