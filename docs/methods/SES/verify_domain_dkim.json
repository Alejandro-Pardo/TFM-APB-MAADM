  "description": "Returns a set of DKIM tokens for a domain identity. You use the tokens that are generated by this operation to create CNAME records. When Amazon SES detects that you've added these records to the DNS configuration for a domain, you can start sending email from that domain. You can start sending email even if you haven't added the TXT record provided by the VerifyDomainIdentity operation to the DNS configuration for your domain. All email that you send from the domain is authenticated using DKIM. To create the CNAME records for DKIM authentication, use the following values: In the preceding example, replace token with one of the tokens that are generated when you execute this operation. Replace example.com with your domain. Repeat this process for each token that's generated by this operation. You can execute this operation no more than once per second.",
