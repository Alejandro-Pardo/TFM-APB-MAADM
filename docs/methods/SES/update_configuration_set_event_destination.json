Set to true to enable publishing to this destination; set to false to prevent publishing to this destination. The default value is false. The type of email sending events to publish to the event destination. send - The call was successful and Amazon SES is attempting to deliver the email. reject - Amazon SES determined that the email contained a virus and rejected it. bounce - The recipient's mail server permanently rejected the email. This corresponds to a hard bounce. complaint - The recipient marked the email as spam. delivery - Amazon SES successfully delivered the email to the recipient's mail server. open - The recipient received the email and opened it in their email client. click - The recipient clicked one or more links in the email. renderingFailure - Amazon SES did not send the email because of a template rendering issue. (string) --- KinesisFirehoseDestination (dict) --- An object that contains the delivery stream ARN and the IAM role ARN associated with an Amazon Kinesis Firehose event destination. The ARN of the IAM role under which Amazon SES publishes email sending events to the Amazon Kinesis Firehose stream.

The place where Amazon SES finds the value of a dimension to publish to Amazon CloudWatch. To use the message tags that you specify using an X-SES-MESSAGE-TAGS header or a parameter to the SendEmail/ SendRawEmail API, specify messageTag. To use your own email headers, specify emailHeader. To put a custom tag on any link included in your email, specify linkTag. The default value of the dimension that is published to Amazon CloudWatch if you do not provide the value of the dimension when you send an email. The default value must meet the following requirements: Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), dashes (-), at signs (@), or periods (.).
