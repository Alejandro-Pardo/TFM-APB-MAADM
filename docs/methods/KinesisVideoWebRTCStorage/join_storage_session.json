  "description": "Join the ongoing one way-video and/or multi-way audio WebRTC session as a video producing device for an input channel. If there's no existing session for the channel, a new streaming session needs to be created, and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the signaling channel must be provided. Currently for the SINGLE_MASTER type, a video producing device is able to ingest both audio and video media into a stream. Only video producing devices can join the session and record media. The resulting ingested video in the Kinesis video stream will have the following parameters: H.264 video and AAC audio. Once a master participant has negotiated a connection through WebRTC, the ingested media session will be stored in the Kinesis video stream. Multiple viewers are then able to play back real-time media through our Playback APIs. You can also use existing Kinesis Video Streams features like HLS or DASH playback, image generation via GetImages, and more with ingested WebRTC media.",
