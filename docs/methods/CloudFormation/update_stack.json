CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account, for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability. If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability. If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM. If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error. If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the template using this capability. (string) ---",
