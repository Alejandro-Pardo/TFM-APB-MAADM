  "description": "Detect drift on a stack set. When CloudFormation performs drift detection on a stack set, it performs drift detection on the stack associated with each stack instance in the stack set. For more information, see Performing drift detection on CloudFormation StackSets. DetectStackSetDrift returns the OperationId of the stack set drift detection operation. Use this operation id with  DescribeStackSetOperation to monitor the progress of the drift detection operation. The drift detection operation may take some time, depending on the number of stack instances included in the stack set, in addition to the number of resources included in each stack. Once the operation has completed, use the following actions to return drift information: You can only run a single drift detection operation on a given stack set at one time. To stop a drift detection stack set operation, use  StopStackSetOperation.",

For more information about maximum concurrent accounts and failure tolerance, see Stack set operation options. RegionConcurrencyType (string) --- The concurrency type of deploying StackSets operations in Regions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time. RegionOrder (list) --- The order of the Regions where you want to perform the stack operation. (string) --- FailureToleranceCount (integer) --- The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions. Conditional: You must specify either FailureToleranceCount or FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both). By default, 0 is specified. FailureTolerancePercentage (integer) --- The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack operation can fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number. Conditional: You must specify either FailureToleranceCount or FailureTolerancePercentage, but not both. MaxConcurrentCount (integer) --- The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time. This can depend on the value of FailureToleranceCount depending on your ConcurrencyMode. MaxConcurrentCount is at most one more than the FailureToleranceCount if you're using STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE. Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling. Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or MaxConcurrentPercentage, but not both. By default, 1 is specified. MaxConcurrentPercentage (integer) --- The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time. This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number as one instead. ConcurrencyMode (string) --- Specifies how the concurrency level behaves during the operation execution. STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE: This option dynamically lowers the concurrency level to ensure the number of failed accounts never exceeds the value of FailureToleranceCount +1. The initial actual concurrency is set to the lower of either the value of the MaxConcurrentCount, or the value of FailureToleranceCount +1. The actual concurrency is then reduced proportionally by the number of failures. This is the default behavior. If failure tolerance or Maximum concurrent accounts are set to percentages, the behavior is similar. SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE: This option decouples FailureToleranceCount from the actual concurrency. This allows stack set operations to run at the concurrency level set by the MaxConcurrentCount value, or MaxConcurrentPercentage, regardless of the number of failures.",
