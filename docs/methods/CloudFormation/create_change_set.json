  "description": "Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you can review the changes before executing them. You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist or an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change set shows all of the resources that CloudFormation will create. If you create a change set for an existing stack, CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand which resources CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack. To create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, for the ChangeSetType parameter, specify CREATE. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify UPDATE for the ChangeSetType parameter. To create a change set for an import operation, specify IMPORT for the ChangeSetType parameter. After the CreateChangeSet call successfully completes, CloudFormation starts creating the change set. To check the status of the change set or to review it, use the  DescribeChangeSet action. When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make, execute the change set by using the  ExecuteChangeSet action. CloudFormation doesn't make changes until you execute the change set. To create a change set for the entire stack hierarchy, set IncludeNestedStacks to True.",

CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability. If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability. If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM. If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error. If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. (string) ---",
