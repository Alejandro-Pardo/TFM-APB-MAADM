Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions. When specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance operations: To override the current value for a parameter, include the parameter and specify its value. To leave an overridden parameter set to its present value, include the parameter and specify UsePreviousValue as true. (You can't specify both a value and set UsePreviousValue to true.) To set an overridden parameter back to the value specified in the stack set, specify a parameter list but don't include the parameter in the list. To leave all parameters set to their present values, don't specify this property at all. During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value. You can only override the parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set template. (dict) --- The Parameter data type. ParameterKey (string) --- The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses the default value that's specified in your template. ParameterValue (string) --- The input value associated with the parameter. UsePreviousValue (boolean) --- During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify true, do not specify a parameter value. ResolvedValue (string) --- Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for Systems Manager parameter types in the template.

RegionConcurrencyType (string) --- The concurrency type of deploying StackSets operations in Regions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time. RegionOrder (list) --- The order of the Regions where you want to perform the stack operation. (string) --- FailureToleranceCount (integer) --- The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions. Conditional: You must specify either FailureToleranceCount or FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both). By default, 0 is specified. FailureTolerancePercentage (integer) --- The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack operation can fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number. Conditional: You must specify either FailureToleranceCount or FailureTolerancePercentage, but not both. MaxConcurrentCount (integer) --- The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time. This can depend on the value of FailureToleranceCount depending on your ConcurrencyMode. MaxConcurrentCount is at most one more than the FailureToleranceCount if you're using STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE. Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum for operations. For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service throttling. Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or MaxConcurrentPercentage, but not both. By default, 1 is specified. MaxConcurrentPercentage (integer) --- The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this operation at one time. This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number as one instead. ConcurrencyMode (string) --- Specifies how the concurrency level behaves during the operation execution. STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE: This option dynamically lowers the concurrency level to ensure the number of failed accounts never exceeds the value of FailureToleranceCount +1. The initial actual concurrency is set to the lower of either the value of the MaxConcurrentCount, or the value of FailureToleranceCount +1. The actual concurrency is then reduced proportionally by the number of failures. This is the default behavior. If failure tolerance or Maximum concurrent accounts are set to percentages, the behavior is similar. SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE: This option decouples FailureToleranceCount from the actual concurrency. This allows stack set operations to run at the concurrency level set by the MaxConcurrentCount value, or MaxConcurrentPercentage, regardless of the number of failures.",
