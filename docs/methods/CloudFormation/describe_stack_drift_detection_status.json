  "description": "Returns information about a stack drift detection operation. A stack drift detection operation detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has drifted, from its expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources have drifted. For more information about stack and resource drift, see Detect unmanaged configuration changes to stacks and resources with drift detection. Use  DetectStackDrift to initiate a stack drift detection operation. DetectStackDrift returns a StackDriftDetectionId you can use to monitor the progress of the operation using DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus. Once the drift detection operation has completed, use  DescribeStackResourceDrifts to return drift information about the stack and its resources.",
