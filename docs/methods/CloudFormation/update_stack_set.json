The initial actual concurrency is set to the lower of either the value of the MaxConcurrentCount, or the value of FailureToleranceCount +1. The actual concurrency is then reduced proportionally by the number of failures. This is the default behavior. If failure tolerance or Maximum concurrent accounts are set to percentages, the behavior is similar. SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE: This option decouples FailureToleranceCount from the actual concurrency.
