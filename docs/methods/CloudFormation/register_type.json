Registering an extension makes it available for use in CloudFormation templates in your Amazon Web Services account, and includes: For more information about how to develop extensions and ready them for registration, see Creating resource types using the CloudFormation CLI in the CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide. You can have a maximum of 50 resource extension versions registered at a time. This maximum is per account and per Region. Use DeregisterType to deregister specific extension versions if necessary. Once you have initiated a registration request using  RegisterType, you can use  DescribeTypeRegistration to monitor the progress of the registration request. Once you have registered a private extension in your account and Region, use SetTypeConfiguration to specify configuration properties for the extension. For more information, see Edit configuration data for extensions in your account in the CloudFormation User Guide.",
