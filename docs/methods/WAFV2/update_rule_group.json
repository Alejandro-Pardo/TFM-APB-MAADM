  "description": "Updates the specified  RuleGroup. A rule group defines a collection of rules to inspect and control web requests that you can use in a  WebACL. When you create a rule group, you define an immutable capacity limit. If you update a rule group, you must stay within the capacity. This allows others to reuse the rule group with confidence in its capacity requirements. When you create or change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of time to propagate to all areas where the resources are stored. The propagation time can be from a few seconds to a number of minutes. The following are examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during change propagation:",
