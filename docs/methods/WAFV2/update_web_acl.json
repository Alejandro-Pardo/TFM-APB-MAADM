  "description": "Updates the specified  WebACL. While updating a web ACL, WAF provides continuous coverage to the resources that you have associated with the web ACL. A web ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and control web requests. Each rule has a statement that defines what to look for in web requests and an action that WAF applies to requests that match the statement. In the web ACL, you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types  Rule,  RuleGroup, and managed rule group. You can associate a web ACL with one or more Amazon Web Services resources to protect. The resource types include Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service, Amplify application, and Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. When you create or change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of time to propagate to all areas where the resources are stored. The propagation time can be from a few seconds to a number of minutes. The following are examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during change propagation:",
