  "description": "Creates a  RuleGroup per the specifications provided. A rule group defines a collection of rules to inspect and control web requests that you can use in a  WebACL. When you create a rule group, you define an immutable capacity limit. If you update a rule group, you must stay within the capacity. This allows others to reuse the rule group with confidence in its capacity requirements.",
