Customers retrieve their managed rule group list by calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups.

Customers can retrieve the available versions for a managed rule group by calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroupVersions. You provide a rule group specification for each version. For each managed rule set, you must specify a version that you recommend using. To initiate the expiration of a managed rule group version, use  UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate.",
