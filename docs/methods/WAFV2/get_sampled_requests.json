You can specify a sample size of up to 500 requests, and you can specify any time range in the previous three hours. GetSampledRequests returns a time range, which is usually the time range that you specified. However, if your resource (such as a CloudFront distribution) received 5,000 requests before the specified time range elapsed, GetSampledRequests returns an updated time range.
