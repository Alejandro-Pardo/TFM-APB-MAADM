The possible values are: attachment.transit-gateway-attachment-id - The id of the transit gateway attachment. attachment.resource-id - The resource id of the transit gateway attachment. route-search.exact-match - The exact match of the specified filter. route-search.longest-prefix-match - The longest prefix that matches the route. route-search.subnet-of-match - The routes with a subnet that match the specified CIDR filter. route-search.supernet-of-match - The routes with a CIDR that encompass the CIDR filter. For example, if you have 10.0.1.0/29 and 10.0.1.0/31 routes in your route table and you specify supernet-of-match as 10.0.1.0/30, then the result returns 10.0.1.0/29. state - The state of the route ( active | blackhole). transit-gateway-route-destination-cidr-block - The CIDR range. type - The type of route ( propagated | static). (dict) --- A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an AND, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters. For more information, see List and filter using the CLI and API in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Name (string) --- The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive. Values (list) --- The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an OR, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values. (string) ---",
