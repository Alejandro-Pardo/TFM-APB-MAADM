The high byte is used for internal purposes and should be ignored. The low byte is set based on the state represented. The valid values are 0 (pending), 16 (running), 32 (shutting-down), 48 (terminated), 64 (stopping), and 80 (stopped). instance-state-name - The state of the instance ( pending | running | shutting-down | terminated | stopping | stopped). instance-status.reachability - Filters on instance status where the name is reachability ( passed | failed | initializing | insufficient-data). instance-status.status - The status of the instance ( ok | impaired | initializing | insufficient-data | not-applicable). operator.managed - A Boolean that indicates whether this is a managed instance. operator.principal - The principal that manages the instance. Only valid for managed instances, where managed is true. system-status.reachability - Filters on system status where the name is reachability ( passed | failed | initializing | insufficient-data). system-status.status - The system status of the instance ( ok | impaired | initializing | insufficient-data | not-applicable). attached-ebs-status.status - The status of the attached EBS volume for the instance ( ok | impaired | initializing | insufficient-data | not-applicable). (dict) --- A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an AND, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters. For more information, see List and filter using the CLI and API in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Name (string) --- The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive. Values (list) --- The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an OR, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values. (string) ---",
