  "description": "Sets the AMI state to disabled and removes all launch permissions from the AMI. A disabled AMI can't be used for instance launches. A disabled AMI can't be shared. If an AMI was public or previously shared, it is made private. If an AMI was shared with an Amazon Web Services account, organization, or Organizational Unit, they lose access to the disabled AMI. A disabled AMI does not appear in DescribeImages API calls by default. Only the AMI owner can disable an AMI. You can re-enable a disabled AMI using EnableImage. For more information, see Disable an AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.",
