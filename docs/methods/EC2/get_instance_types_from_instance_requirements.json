Max (integer) --- The maximum number of vCPUs. To specify no maximum limit, omit this parameter. The minimum and maximum amount of memory, in MiB. The minimum amount of memory, in MiB. Max (integer) --- The maximum amount of memory, in MiB. CpuManufacturers (list) --- The CPU manufacturers to include. For instance types with Intel CPUs, specify intel. For instance types with AMD CPUs, specify amd. For instance types with Amazon Web Services CPUs, specify amazon-web-services. For instance types with Apple CPUs, specify apple. Default: Any manufacturer (string) --- MemoryGiBPerVCpu (dict) --- The minimum and maximum amount of memory per vCPU, in GiB. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (float) --- The minimum amount of memory per vCPU, in GiB. To specify no minimum limit, omit this parameter. Max (float) --- The maximum amount of memory per vCPU, in GiB. ExcludedInstanceTypes (list) --- The instance types to exclude. You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk ( *), to exclude an instance family, type, size, or generation. The following are examples: m5.8xlarge, c5*.*, m5a.*, r*, *3*. For example, if you specify c5*,Amazon EC2 will exclude the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 will exclude all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: No excluded instance types (string) --- InstanceGenerations (list) --- Indicates whether current or previous generation instance types are included. The current generation instance types are recommended for use. Current generation instance types are typically the latest two to three generations in each instance family. For more information, see Instance types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. For current generation instance types, specify current. For previous generation instance types, specify previous. Default: Current and previous generation instance types (string) --- SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice (integer) --- [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified Spot price. The identified Spot price is the Spot price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified Spot price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, and failing that, from the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. When Amazon EC2 selects instance types with your attributes, it will exclude instance types whose Spot price exceeds your specified threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 interprets as a percentage. If you set TargetCapacityUnitType to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is applied based on the per-vCPU or per-memory price instead of the per-instance price. This parameter is not supported for GetSpotPlacementScores and GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements. Default: 100 OnDemandMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice (integer) --- [Price protection] The price protection threshold for On-Demand Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified On-Demand price.

To indicate no price protection threshold, specify a high value, such as 999999.

Default: included LocalStorageTypes (list) --- The type of local storage that is required. For instance types with hard disk drive (HDD) storage, specify hdd. For instance types with solid state drive (SSD) storage, specify ssd. Default: hdd and ssd (string) --- TotalLocalStorageGB (dict) --- The minimum and maximum amount of total local storage, in GB. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (float) --- The minimum amount of total local storage, in GB. Max (float) --- The maximum amount of total local storage, in GB. BaselineEbsBandwidthMbps (dict) --- The minimum and maximum baseline bandwidth to Amazon EBS, in Mbps. For more information, see Amazon EBS---optimized instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (integer) --- The minimum baseline bandwidth, in Mbps. Max (integer) --- The maximum baseline bandwidth, in Mbps. AcceleratorTypes (list) --- The accelerator types that must be on the instance type. For instance types with FPGA accelerators, specify fpga. For instance types with GPU accelerators, specify gpu. For instance types with Inference accelerators, specify inference. Default: Any accelerator type (string) --- AcceleratorCount (dict) --- The minimum and maximum number of accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs, or Amazon Web Services Inferentia chips) on an instance. To exclude accelerator-enabled instance types, set Max to 0. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (integer) --- The minimum number of accelerators.

For instance types with Amazon Web Services devices, specify amazon-web-services. For instance types with AMD devices, specify amd. For instance types with Habana devices, specify habana. For instance types with NVIDIA devices, specify nvidia. For instance types with Xilinx devices, specify xilinx.

For more information, see Amazon EC2 instance network bandwidth in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Default: No minimum or maximum limits Min (float) --- The minimum amount of network bandwidth, in Gbps. Max (float) --- The maximum amount of network bandwidth, in Gbps. AllowedInstanceTypes (list) --- The instance types to apply your specified attributes against. All other instance types are ignored, even if they match your specified attributes. You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk ( *), to allow an instance type, size, or generation. For example, if you specify c5*,Amazon EC2 will allow the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 will allow all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: All instance types (string) --- MaxSpotPriceAsPercentageOfOptimalOnDemandPrice (integer) --- [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage of an identified On-Demand price. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, and failing that, from the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. If you set TargetCapacityUnitType to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is based on the per vCPU or per memory price instead of the per instance price. BaselinePerformanceFactors (dict) --- The baseline performance to consider, using an instance family as a baseline reference. The instance family establishes the lowest acceptable level of performance. Amazon EC2 uses this baseline to guide instance type selection, but there is no guarantee that the selected instance types will always exceed the baseline for every application. Currently, this parameter only supports CPU performance as a baseline performance factor. For more information, see Performance protection in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Cpu (dict) --- The CPU performance to consider, using an instance family as the baseline reference. References (list) --- Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture differences. (dict) --- Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture. InstanceFamily (string) --- The instance family to use as a baseline reference. The following instance families are not supported for performance protection: c1 g3 | g3s hpc7g m1 | m2 mac1 | mac2 | mac2-m1ultra | mac2-m2 | mac2-m2pro p3dn | p4d | p5 t1 u-12tb1 | u-18tb1 | u-24tb1 | u-3tb1 | u-6tb1 | u-9tb1 | u7i-12tb | u7in-16tb | u7in-24tb | u7in-32tb If you enable performance protection by specifying a supported instance family, the returned instance types will exclude the above unsupported instance families. If you specify an unsupported instance family as a value for baseline performance, the API returns an empty response for GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements and an exception for CreateFleet, RequestSpotFleet, ModifyFleet, and ModifySpotFleetRequest.",
