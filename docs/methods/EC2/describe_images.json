You can use a wildcard ( *), for example, 2021-09-29T*, which matches an entire day. description - The description of the image (provided during image creation). ena-support - A Boolean that indicates whether enhanced networking with ENA is enabled. hypervisor - The hypervisor type ( ovm | xen). image-allowed - A Boolean that indicates whether the image meets the criteria specified for Allowed AMIs. image-id - The ID of the image. image-type - The image type ( machine | kernel | ramdisk). is-public - A Boolean that indicates whether the image is public. kernel-id - The kernel ID. manifest-location - The location of the image manifest. name - The name of the AMI (provided during image creation). owner-alias - The owner alias ( amazon | aws-backup-vault | aws-marketplace). The valid aliases are defined in an Amazon-maintained list. This is not the Amazon Web Services account alias that can be set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use the Owner request parameter instead of this filter. owner-id - The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner. platform - The platform. The only supported value is windows. product-code - The product code. product-code.type - The type of the product code ( marketplace). ramdisk-id - The RAM disk ID. root-device-name - The device name of the root device volume (for example, /dev/sda1). root-device-type - The type of the root device volume ( ebs | instance-store). source-image-id - The ID of the source AMI from which the AMI was created. source-image-region - The Region of the source AMI. source-instance-id - The ID of the instance that the AMI was created from if the AMI was created using CreateImage. This filter is applicable only if the AMI was created using CreateImage. state - The state of the image ( available | pending | failed). state-reason-code - The reason code for the state change. state-reason-message - The message for the state change. sriov-net-support - A value of simple indicates that enhanced networking with the Intel 82599 VF interface is enabled. tag:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA, specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value. tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value. virtualization-type - The virtualization type ( paravirtual | hvm). (dict) --- A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an AND, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters. For more information, see List and filter using the CLI and API in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Name (string) --- The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive. Values (list) --- The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an OR, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values. (string) ---",
