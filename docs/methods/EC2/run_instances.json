  "description": "Launches the specified number of instances using an AMI for which you have permissions. You can specify a number of options, or leave the default options. The following rules apply: You can create a launch template, which is a resource that contains the parameters to launch an instance. When you launch an instance using  RunInstances, you can specify the launch template instead of specifying the launch parameters. To ensure faster instance launches, break up large requests into smaller batches. For example, create five separate launch requests for 100 instances each instead of one launch request for 500 instances. RunInstances is subject to both request rate limiting and resource rate limiting. For more information, see Request throttling. An instance is ready for you to use when it's in the running state. You can check the state of your instance using  DescribeInstances. You can tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both. For more information, see  CreateTags and Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources. Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at boot. You can use this key to provide secure access to the instance. Amazon EC2 public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords. For more information, see Key pairs. For troubleshooting, see What to do if an instance immediately terminates, and Troubleshooting connecting to your instance.",

    {
      "name": "BlockDeviceMappings",
      "type": "list",
      "required": false,
      "description": "The block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to the instance at launch. For more information, see Block device mappings in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. (dict) --- Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch. Ebs (dict) --- Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched. DeleteOnTermination (boolean) --- Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Iops (integer) --- The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3, io1, and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting. The following are the supported values for each volume type: gp3: 3,000 - 16,000 IOPS io1: 100 - 64,000 IOPS io2: 100 - 256,000 IOPS For io2 volumes, you can achieve up to 256,000 IOPS on instances built on the Nitro System. On other instances, you can achieve performance up to 32,000 IOPS. This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. SnapshotId (string) --- The ID of the snapshot. VolumeSize (integer) --- The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size. The following are the supported sizes for each volume type: gp2 and gp3: 1 - 16,384 GiB io1: 4 - 16,384 GiB io2: 4 - 65,536 GiB st1 and sc1: 125 - 16,384 GiB standard: 1 - 1024 GiB VolumeType (string) --- The volume type. For more information, see Amazon EBS volume types in the Amazon EBS User Guide. KmsKeyId (string) --- Identifier (key ID, key alias, key ARN, or alias ARN) of the customer managed KMS key to use for EBS encryption. This parameter is only supported on BlockDeviceMapping objects called by RunInstances, RequestSpotFleet, and RequestSpotInstances. Throughput (integer) --- The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s. This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes. Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000. OutpostArn (string) --- The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored. This parameter is not supported when using CreateImage. Encrypted (boolean) --- Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EBS User Guide. In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume. Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see Supported instance types. This parameter is not returned by  DescribeImageAttribute. For  CreateImage and  RegisterImage, whether you can include this parameter, and the allowed values differ depending on the type of block device mapping you are creating. If you are creating a block device mapping for a new (empty) volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true for an encrypted volume, or false for an unencrypted volume. If you omit this parameter, it defaults to false (unencrypted). If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted or unencrypted snapshot, you must omit this parameter. If you include this parameter, the request will fail, regardless of the value that you specify. If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing unencrypted volume, you can include this parameter, but you must specify false. If you specify true, the request will fail. In this case, we recommend that you omit the parameter. If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true or false. However, if you specify false, the parameter is ignored and the block device mapping is always encrypted. NoDevice (string) --- To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify an empty string. When this property is specified, the device is removed from the block device mapping regardless of the assigned value. DeviceName (string) --- The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh). VirtualName (string) --- The virtual device name ( ephemeral``N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ``ephemeral0 and ephemeral1. The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume. NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect. Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.",
