  "description": "Detaches an EBS volume from an instance. Make sure to unmount any file systems on the device within your operating system before detaching the volume. Failure to do so can result in the volume becoming stuck in the busy state while detaching. If this happens, detachment can be delayed indefinitely until you unmount the volume, force detachment, reboot the instance, or all three. If an EBS volume is the root device of an instance, it can't be detached while the instance is running. To detach the root volume, stop the instance first. When a volume with an Amazon Web Services Marketplace product code is detached from an instance, the product code is no longer associated with the instance. You can't detach or force detach volumes that are attached to Amazon ECS or Fargate tasks. Attempting to do this results in the UnsupportedOperationException exception with the Unable to detach volume attached to ECS tasks error message. For more information, see Detach an Amazon EBS volume in the Amazon EBS User Guide.",
