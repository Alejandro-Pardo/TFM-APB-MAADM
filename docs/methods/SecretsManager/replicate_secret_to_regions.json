Do not include sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail. Required permissions: secretsmanager:ReplicateSecretToRegions. If the primary secret is encrypted with a KMS key other than aws/secretsmanager, you also need kms:Decrypt permission to the key. To encrypt the replicated secret with a KMS key other than aws/secretsmanager, you need kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Encrypt to the key.
