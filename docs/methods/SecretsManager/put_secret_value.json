  "description": "Creates a new version with a new encrypted secret value and attaches it to the secret. The version can contain a new SecretString value or a new SecretBinary value. We recommend you avoid calling PutSecretValue at a sustained rate of more than once every 10 minutes. When you update the secret value, Secrets Manager creates a new version of the secret. Secrets Manager removes outdated versions when there are more than 100, but it does not remove versions created less than 24 hours ago. If you call PutSecretValue more than once every 10 minutes, you create more versions than Secrets Manager removes, and you will reach the quota for secret versions. You can specify the staging labels to attach to the new version in VersionStages. If you don't include VersionStages, then Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label AWSCURRENT to this version. If this operation creates the first version for the secret, then Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to it. If this operation moves the staging label AWSCURRENT from another version to this version, then Secrets Manager also automatically moves the staging label AWSPREVIOUS to the version that AWSCURRENT was removed from. This operation is idempotent. If you call this operation with a ClientRequestToken that matches an existing version's VersionId, and you specify the same secret data, the operation succeeds but does nothing. However, if the secret data is different, then the operation fails because you can't modify an existing version; you can only create new ones. Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters except SecretBinary, SecretString, or RotationToken because it might be logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail. Required permissions: secretsmanager:PutSecretValue. For more information, see IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager and Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager.",

Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret. If the ClientRequestToken value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created. If a version with this value already exists and that version's SecretString or SecretBinary values are the same as those in the request then the request is ignored. The operation is idempotent. If a version with this value already exists and the version of the SecretString and SecretBinary values are different from those in the request, then the request fails because you can't modify a secret version.
