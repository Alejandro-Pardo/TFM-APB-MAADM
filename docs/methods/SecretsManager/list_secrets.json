To see secrets marked for deletion, use the Secrets Manager console. All Secrets Manager operations are eventually consistent. ListSecrets might not reflect changes from the last five minutes. You can get more recent information for a specific secret by calling  DescribeSecret. To list the versions of a secret, use  ListSecretVersionIds. To retrieve the values for the secrets, call  BatchGetSecretValue or  GetSecretValue. For information about finding secrets in the console, see Find secrets in Secrets Manager. Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged.
