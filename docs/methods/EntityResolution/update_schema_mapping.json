A string containing the field name. The type of the attribute, selected from a list of values.

For example, when working with columns such as NAME_FIRST, NAME_MIDDLE, and NAME_LAST, assigning them a common groupName will prompt Entity Resolution to concatenate them into a single value. matchKey (string) --- A key that allows grouping of multiple input attributes into a unified matching group. For example, consider a scenario where the source table contains various addresses, such as business_address and shipping_address. By assigning a matchKey called address to both attributes, Entity Resolution will match records across these fields to create a consolidated matching group. If no matchKey is specified for a column, it won't be utilized for matching purposes but will still be included in the output table. subType (string) --- The subtype of the attribute, selected from a list of values. hashed (boolean) --- Indicates if the column values are hashed in the schema input. If the value is set to TRUE, the column values are hashed. If the value is set to FALSE, the column values are cleartext.",
