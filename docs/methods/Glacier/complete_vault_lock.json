  "description": "This operation completes the vault locking process by transitioning the vault lock from the InProgress state to the Locked state, which causes the vault lock policy to become unchangeable. A vault lock is put into the InProgress state by calling  InitiateVaultLock. You can obtain the state of the vault lock by calling  GetVaultLock. For more information about the vault locking process, Amazon Glacier Vault Lock. This operation is idempotent. This request is always successful if the vault lock is in the Locked state and the provided lock ID matches the lock ID originally used to lock the vault. If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the Locked state, the operation returns an AccessDeniedException error. If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the InProgress state, the operation throws an InvalidParameter error.",
