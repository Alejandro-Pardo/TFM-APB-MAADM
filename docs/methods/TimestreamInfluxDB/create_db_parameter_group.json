      "description": "A list of the parameters that comprise the DB parameter group. InfluxDBv2 (dict) --- All the customer-modifiable InfluxDB v2 parameters in Timestream for InfluxDB. fluxLogEnabled (boolean) --- Include option to show detailed logs for Flux queries. Default: false logLevel (string) --- Log output level. InfluxDB outputs log entries with severity levels greater than or equal to the level specified. Default: info noTasks (boolean) --- Disable the task scheduler. If problematic tasks prevent InfluxDB from starting, use this option to start InfluxDB without scheduling or executing tasks. Default: false queryConcurrency (integer) --- Number of queries allowed to execute concurrently. Setting to 0 allows an unlimited number of concurrent queries. Default: 0 queryQueueSize (integer) --- Maximum number of queries allowed in execution queue. When queue limit is reached, new queries are rejected. Setting to 0 allows an unlimited number of queries in the queue. Default: 0 tracingType (string) --- Enable tracing in InfluxDB and specifies the tracing type. Tracing is disabled by default. metricsDisabled (boolean) --- Disable the HTTP /metrics endpoint which exposes internal InfluxDB metrics. Default: false httpIdleTimeout (dict) --- Maximum duration the server should keep established connections alive while waiting for new requests. Set to 0 for no timeout. Default: 3 minutes The type of duration for InfluxDB parameters. The value of duration for InfluxDB parameters. httpReadHeaderTimeout (dict) --- Maximum duration the server should try to read HTTP headers for new requests. Default: 10 seconds The type of duration for InfluxDB parameters. httpReadTimeout (dict) --- Maximum duration the server should try to read the entirety of new requests. Default: 0 The type of duration for InfluxDB parameters. httpWriteTimeout (dict) --- Maximum duration the server should spend processing and responding to write requests. influxqlMaxSelectBuckets (integer) --- Maximum number of group by time buckets a SELECT statement can create. 0 allows an unlimited number of buckets. Default: 0 influxqlMaxSelectPoint (integer) --- Maximum number of points a SELECT statement can process. 0 allows an unlimited number of points. InfluxDB checks the point count every second (so queries exceeding the maximum aren't immediately aborted). Default: 0 influxqlMaxSelectSeries (integer) --- Maximum number of series a SELECT statement can return. 0 allows an unlimited number of series. Default: 0 pprofDisabled (boolean) --- Disable the /debug/pprof HTTP endpoint. This endpoint provides runtime profiling data and can be helpful when debugging. Default: true queryInitialMemoryBytes (integer) --- Initial bytes of memory allocated for a query. Default: 0 queryMaxMemoryBytes (integer) --- Maximum number of queries allowed in execution queue. Default: 0 queryMemoryBytes (integer) --- Maximum bytes of memory allowed for a single query. Must be greater or equal to queryInitialMemoryBytes. Default: 0 sessionLength (integer) --- Specifies the Time to Live (TTL) in minutes for newly created user sessions. Default: 60 sessionRenewDisabled (boolean) --- Disables automatically extending a user's session TTL on each request. By default, every request sets the session's expiration time to five minutes from now. When disabled, sessions expire after the specified session length and the user is redirected to the login page, even if recently active. Default: false storageCacheMaxMemorySize (integer) --- Maximum size (in bytes) a shard's cache can reach before it starts rejecting writes. Must be greater than storageCacheSnapShotMemorySize and lower than instance's total memory capacity. We recommend setting it to below 15% of the total memory capacity. Default: 1073741824 storageCacheSnapshotMemorySize (integer) --- Size (in bytes) at which the storage engine will snapshot the cache and write it to a TSM file to make more memory available. Must not be greater than storageCacheMaxMemorySize. Default: 26214400 storageCacheSnapshotWriteColdDuration (dict) --- Duration at which the storage engine will snapshot the cache and write it to a new TSM file if the shard hasn't received writes or deletes. Default: 10 minutes The type of duration for InfluxDB parameters. storageCompactFullWriteColdDuration (dict) --- Duration at which the storage engine will compact all TSM files in a shard if it hasn't received writes or deletes. Default: 4 hours The type of duration for InfluxDB parameters. storageCompactThroughputBurst (integer) --- Rate limit (in bytes per second) that TSM compactions can write to disk. Default: 50331648 storageMaxConcurrentCompactions (integer) --- Maximum number of full and level compactions that can run concurrently. A value of 0 results in 50% of runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0) used at runtime. Any number greater than zero limits compactions to that value. This setting does not apply to cache snapshotting. Default: 0 storageMaxIndexLogFileSize (integer) --- Size (in bytes) at which an index write-ahead log (WAL) file will compact into an index file. Lower sizes will cause log files to be compacted more quickly and result in lower heap usage at the expense of write throughput. Default: 1048576 storageNoValidateFieldSize (boolean) --- Skip field size validation on incoming write requests. Default: false storageRetentionCheckInterval (dict) --- Interval of retention policy enforcement checks. Must be greater than 0. Default: 30 minutes The type of duration for InfluxDB parameters. storageSeriesFileMaxConcurrentSnapshotCompactions (integer) --- Maximum number of snapshot compactions that can run concurrently across all series partitions in a database. Default: 0 storageSeriesIdSetCacheSize (integer) --- Size of the internal cache used in the TSI index to store previously calculated series results. Cached results are returned quickly rather than needing to be recalculated when a subsequent query with the same tag key/value predicate is executed. Setting this value to 0 will disable the cache and may decrease query performance. Default: 100 storageWalMaxConcurrentWrites (integer) --- Maximum number writes to the WAL directory to attempt at the same time. Setting this value to 0 results in number of processing units available x2. Default: 0 storageWalMaxWriteDelay (dict) --- Maximum amount of time a write request to the WAL directory will wait when the maximum number of concurrent active writes to the WAL directory has been met. Set to 0 to disable the timeout. uiDisabled (boolean) --- Disable the InfluxDB user interface (UI). The UI is enabled by default. Default: false.",
