The SCEP protocol uses a challenge password to authenticate a request before issuing a certificate from a certificate authority (CA). Your SCEP clients include the challenge password as part of their certificate request to Connector for SCEP. To retrieve the connector Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the connectors in your account, call ListConnectors. To create additional challenge passwords for the connector, call CreateChallenge again. We recommend frequently rotating your challenge passwords.",
