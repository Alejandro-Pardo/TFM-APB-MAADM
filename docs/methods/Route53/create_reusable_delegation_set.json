  "description": "Creates a delegation set (a group of four name servers) that can be reused by multiple hosted zones that were created by the same Amazon Web Services account. You can also create a reusable delegation set that uses the four name servers that are associated with an existing hosted zone. Specify the hosted zone ID in the CreateReusableDelegationSet request. For information about using a reusable delegation set to configure white label name servers, see Configuring White Label Name Servers. The process for migrating existing hosted zones to use a reusable delegation set is comparable to the process for configuring white label name servers. You need to perform the following steps: If you want to migrate existing hosted zones to use a reusable delegation set, the existing hosted zones can't use any of the name servers that are assigned to the reusable delegation set. If one or more hosted zones do use one or more name servers that are assigned to the reusable delegation set, you can do one of the following:",
