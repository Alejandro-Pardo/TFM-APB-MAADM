  "description": "Creates a new public or private hosted zone. You create records in a public hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic on the internet for a domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (apex.example.com, acme.example.com). You create records in a private hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs). For more information about charges for hosted zones, see Amazon Route 53 Pricing. Note the following: When you submit a CreateHostedZone request, the initial status of the hosted zone is PENDING. For public hosted zones, this means that the NS and SOA records are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS servers. When the NS and SOA records are available, the status of the zone changes to INSYNC. The CreateHostedZone request requires the caller to have an ec2:DescribeVpcs permission.",
