This prevents Route 53 from overwriting an intervening update: If the value in the UpdateHealthCheck request matches the value of HealthCheckVersion in the health check, Route 53 updates the health check with the new settings.

If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify in RequestInterval. Using an IP address that is returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress: IPv4 address: four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44. IPv6 address: eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, 2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345. If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for IPAddress. This ensures that the IP address of your instance never changes. For more information, see the applicable documentation: Linux: Elastic IP Addresses (EIP) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances Windows: Elastic IP Addresses (EIP) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances For more information, see FullyQualifiedDomainName. Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents: RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses.",

      "description": "Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for IPAddress. If you specify a value for IPAddress: Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks. When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header: If you specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header. If you specify a value of 443 for Port and HTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header. If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type, Route 53 passes FullyQualifiedDomainName: Port to the endpoint in the Host header. If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Route 53 substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the above cases. If you don't specify a value for IPAddress: If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval you specify in RequestInterval. Using an IPv4 address that is returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, you can't update the health check to remove the FullyQualifiedDomainName; if you don't specify a value for IPAddress on creation, a FullyQualifiedDomainName is required. If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com). In addition, if the value of Type is HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value for IPAddress. If the value of Type is TCP, Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.",
