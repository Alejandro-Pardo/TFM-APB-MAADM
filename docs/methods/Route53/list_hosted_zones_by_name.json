  "description": "Retrieves a list of your hosted zones in lexicographic order. The response includes a HostedZones child element for each hosted zone created by the current Amazon Web Services account. ListHostedZonesByName sorts hosted zones by name with the labels reversed. For example: com.example.www. Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some circumstances. If the domain name includes escape characters or Punycode, ListHostedZonesByName alphabetizes the domain name using the escaped or Punycoded value, which is the format that Amazon Route 53 saves in its database. For example, to create a hosted zone for ex\u00c3\u00a4mple.com, you specify ex344mple.com for the domain name. ListHostedZonesByName alphabetizes it as: com.ex\\344mple. The labels are reversed and alphabetized using the escaped value. For more information about valid domain name formats, including internationalized domain names, see DNS Domain Name Format in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Route 53 returns up to 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of hosted zones, use the MaxItems parameter to list them in groups of up to 100. The response includes values that help navigate from one group of MaxItems hosted zones to the next:",
