  "description": "Lists the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone. ListResourceRecordSets returns up to 300 resource record sets at a time in ASCII order, beginning at a position specified by the name and type elements. ListResourceRecordSets sorts results first by DNS name with the labels reversed, for example: com.example.www. Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order when the record name contains characters that appear before . (decimal 46) in the ASCII table. These characters include the following: ! \" # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - When multiple records have the same DNS name, ListResourceRecordSets sorts results by the record type. You can use the name and type elements to specify the resource record set that the list begins with: The results begin with the first resource record set that the hosted zone contains. The results begin with the first resource record set in the list whose name is greater than or equal to Name. Amazon Route 53 returns the InvalidInput error. The results begin with the first resource record set in the list whose name is greater than or equal to Name, and whose type is greater than or equal to Type. This action returns the most current version of the records. This includes records that are PENDING, and that are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS servers. To ensure that you get an accurate listing of the resource record sets for a hosted zone at a point in time, do not submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request while you're paging through the results of a ListResourceRecordSets request. If you do, some pages may display results without the latest changes while other pages display results with the latest changes. If a ListResourceRecordSets command returns more than one page of results, the value of IsTruncated is true. To display the next page of results, get the values of NextRecordName, NextRecordType, and NextRecordIdentifier (if any) from the response. Then submit another ListResourceRecordSets request, and specify those values for StartRecordName, StartRecordType, and StartRecordIdentifier.",
