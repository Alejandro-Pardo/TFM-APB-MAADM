  "description": "Initiates a new outbound SMS contact to a customer. Response of this API provides the ContactId of the outbound SMS contact created. SourceEndpoint only supports Endpoints with CONNECT_PHONENUMBER_ARN as Type and DestinationEndpoint only supports Endpoints with TELEPHONE_NUMBER as Type. ContactFlowId initiates the flow to manage the new SMS contact created. This API can be used to initiate outbound SMS contacts for an agent, or it can also deflect an ongoing contact to an outbound SMS contact by using the StartOutboundChatContact Flow Action. For more information about using SMS in Amazon Connect, see the following topics in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide:",
