  "description": "Allows you to create a batch of contacts in Amazon Connect. The outbound campaigns capability ingests dial requests via the PutDialRequestBatch API. It then uses BatchPutContact to create contacts corresponding to those dial requests. If agents are available, the dial requests are dialed out, which results in a voice call. The resulting voice call uses the same contactId that was created by BatchPutContact.",
