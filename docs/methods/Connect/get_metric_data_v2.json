For valid values of the metric-level filter FLOWS_OUTCOME_TYPE, see the description for the Flow outcome metric in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. For valid values of the metric-level filter BOT_CONVERSATION_OUTCOME_TYPE, see the description for the Bot conversations completed in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. For valid values of the metric-level filter BOT_INTENT_OUTCOME_TYPE, see the description for the Bot intents completed metric in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. (string) --- Negate (boolean) --- If set to true, the API response contains results that filter out the results matched by the metric-level filters condition. By default, Negate is set to false.",
