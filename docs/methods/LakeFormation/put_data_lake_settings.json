      "description": "A structure representing a list of Lake Formation principals designated as data lake administrators. DataLakeAdmins (list) --- A list of Lake Formation principals. Supported principals are IAM users or IAM roles. (dict) --- The Lake Formation principal. DataLakePrincipalIdentifier (string) --- An identifier for the Lake Formation principal. ReadOnlyAdmins (list) --- A list of Lake Formation principals with only view access to the resources, without the ability to make changes. CreateDatabaseDefaultPermissions (list) --- Specifies whether access control on newly created database is managed by Lake Formation permissions or exclusively by IAM permissions. A null value indicates access control by Lake Formation permissions. A value that assigns ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS indicates access control by IAM permissions. This is referred to as the setting 'Use only IAM access control,' and is for backward compatibility with the Glue permission model implemented by IAM permissions. The only permitted values are an empty array or an array that contains a single JSON object that grants ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS. For more information, see Changing the Default Security Settings for Your Data Lake. (dict) --- Permissions granted to a principal. Principal (dict) --- The principal who is granted permissions. Permissions (list) --- The permissions that are granted to the principal. (string) --- CreateTableDefaultPermissions (list) --- Specifies whether access control on newly created table is managed by Lake Formation permissions or exclusively by IAM permissions. (string) --- Parameters (dict) --- A key-value map that provides an additional configuration on your data lake. CROSS_ACCOUNT_VERSION is the key you can configure in the Parameters field. Accepted values for the CrossAccountVersion key are 1, 2, 3, and 4. (string) --- (string) --- TrustedResourceOwners (list) --- A list of the resource-owning account IDs that the caller's account can use to share their user access details (user ARNs). The user ARNs can be logged in the resource owner's CloudTrail log. You may want to specify this property when you are in a high-trust boundary, such as the same team or company. (string) --- AllowExternalDataFiltering (boolean) --- Whether to allow Amazon EMR clusters to access data managed by Lake Formation. If true, you allow Amazon EMR clusters to access data in Amazon S3 locations that are registered with Lake Formation. If false or null, no Amazon EMR clusters will be able to access data in Amazon S3 locations that are registered with Lake Formation. For more information, see (Optional) Allow external data filtering. AllowFullTableExternalDataAccess (boolean) --- Whether to allow a third-party query engine to get data access credentials without session tags when a caller has full data access permissions. ExternalDataFilteringAllowList (list) --- A list of the account IDs of Amazon Web Services accounts with Amazon EMR clusters that are to perform data filtering.> (dict) --- The Lake Formation principal. AuthorizedSessionTagValueList (list) --- Lake Formation relies on a privileged process secured by Amazon EMR or the third party integrator to tag the user's role while assuming it. Lake Formation will publish the acceptable key-value pair, for example key = 'LakeFormationTrustedCaller' and value = 'TRUE' and the third party integrator must properly tag the temporary security credentials that will be used to call Lake Formation's administrative APIs.
