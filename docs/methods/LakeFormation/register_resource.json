  "description": "Registers the resource as managed by the Data Catalog. To add or update data, Lake Formation needs read/write access to the chosen data location. Choose a role that you know has permission to do this, or choose the AWSServiceRoleForLakeFormationDataAccess service-linked role. When you register the first Amazon S3 path, the service-linked role and a new inline policy are created on your behalf. Lake Formation adds the first path to the inline policy and attaches it to the service-linked role. When you register subsequent paths, Lake Formation adds the path to the existing policy. The following request registers a new location and gives Lake Formation permission to use the service-linked role to access that location. ResourceArn = arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/ UseServiceLinkedRole = true. If UseServiceLinkedRole is not set to true, you must provide or set the RoleArn: arn:aws:iam::12345:role/my-data-access-role.",
