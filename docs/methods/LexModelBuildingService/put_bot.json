When you create or update a bot you are only required to specify a name, a locale, and whether the bot is directed toward children under age 13. You can use this to add intents later, or to remove intents from an existing bot. When you create a bot with the minimum information, the bot is created or updated but Amazon Lex returns the  response FAILED. You can build the bot after you add one or more intents. For more information about Amazon Lex bots, see  how-it-works. If you specify the name of an existing bot, the fields in the request replace the existing values in the $LATEST version of the bot. Amazon Lex removes any fields that you don't provide values for in the request, except for the idleTTLInSeconds and privacySettings fields, which are set to their default values. If you don't specify values for required fields, Amazon Lex throws an exception. This operation requires permissions for the lex:PutBot action. For more information, see  security-iam.",

To specify how many times Amazon Lex should repeat the clarification prompt, use the maxAttempts field. If Amazon Lex still doesn't understand, it sends the message in the abortStatement field. When you create a clarification prompt, make sure that it suggests the correct response from the user. for example, for a bot that orders pizza and drinks, you might create this clarification prompt: 'What would you like to do? You can say --\u0098Order a pizza' or --\u0098Order a drink.'' If you have defined a fallback intent, it will be invoked if the clarification prompt is repeated the number of times defined in the maxAttempts field. For more information, see AMAZON.FallbackIntent. If you don't define a clarification prompt, at runtime Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception in three cases: Follow-up prompt - When the user responds to a follow-up prompt but does not provide an intent. For example, in response to a follow-up prompt that says 'Would you like anything else today?' the user says 'Yes.' Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception because it does not have a clarification prompt to send to the user to get an intent. Lambda function - When using a Lambda function, you return an ElicitIntent dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception. PutSession operation - When using the PutSession operation, you send an ElicitIntent dialog type. An array of objects, each of which provides a message string and its type.

If the user's response is not one of the expected responses (for example, 'thin crust, 'deep dish,' etc.), Amazon Lex tries to elicit a correct response a few more times.
