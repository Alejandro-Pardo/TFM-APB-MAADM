  "description": "Deletes an alias for the specified bot. You can't delete an alias that is used in the association between a bot and a messaging channel. If an alias is used in a channel association, the DeleteBot operation returns a ResourceInUseException exception that includes a reference to the channel association that refers to the bot. You can remove the reference to the alias by deleting the channel association. If you get the same exception again, delete the referring association until the DeleteBotAlias operation is successful.",
