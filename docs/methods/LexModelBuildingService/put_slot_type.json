To create a custom slot type, specify a name for the slot type and a set of enumeration values, which are the values that a slot of this type can assume. For more information, see  how-it-works. If you specify the name of an existing slot type, the fields in the request replace the existing values in the $LATEST version of the slot type. Amazon Lex removes the fields that you don't provide in the request. If you don't specify required fields, Amazon Lex throws an exception. When you update the $LATEST version of a slot type, if a bot uses the $LATEST version of an intent that contains the slot type, the bot's status field is set to NOT_BUILT. This operation requires permissions for the lex:PutSlotType action.",
