  "description": "Enable the Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation for the protected resource. This causes Shield Advanced to create, verify, and apply WAF rules for DDoS attacks that it detects for the resource. Shield Advanced applies the rules in a Shield rule group inside the web ACL that you've associated with the resource. For information about how automatic mitigation works and the requirements for using it, see Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation. To use this feature, you must associate a web ACL with the protected resource. The web ACL must be created using the latest version of WAF (v2). You can associate the web ACL through the Shield Advanced console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/. For more information, see Getting Started with Shield Advanced. You can also associate the web ACL to the resource through the WAF console or the WAF API, but you must manage Shield Advanced automatic mitigation through Shield Advanced. For information about WAF, see WAF Developer Guide.",
