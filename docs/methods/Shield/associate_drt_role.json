  "description": "Authorizes the Shield Response Team (SRT) using the specified role, to access your Amazon Web Services account to assist with DDoS attack mitigation during potential attacks. This enables the SRT to inspect your WAF configuration and create or update WAF rules and web ACLs. You can associate only one RoleArn with your subscription. If you submit an AssociateDRTRole request for an account that already has an associated role, the new RoleArn will replace the existing RoleArn. Prior to making the AssociateDRTRole request, you must attach the AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy managed policy to the role that you'll specify in the request. You can access this policy in the IAM console at AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy. For more information see Adding and removing IAM identity permissions. The role must also trust the service principal drt.shield.amazonaws.com. For more information, see IAM JSON policy elements: Principal. The SRT will have access only to your WAF and Shield resources. By submitting this request, you authorize the SRT to inspect your WAF and Shield configuration and create and update WAF rules and web ACLs on your behalf. The SRT takes these actions only if explicitly authorized by you. You must have the iam:PassRole permission to make an AssociateDRTRole request. For more information, see Granting a user permissions to pass a role to an Amazon Web Services service. To use the services of the SRT and make an AssociateDRTRole request, you must be subscribed to the Business Support plan or the Enterprise Support plan.",
