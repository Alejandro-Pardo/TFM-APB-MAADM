Undefined: Make no changes to the KMS key of the ledger. A valid symmetric customer managed KMS key: Use the specified symmetric encryption KMS key in your account that you create, own, and manage. Amazon QLDB does not support asymmetric keys. For more information, see Using symmetric and asymmetric keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. To specify a customer managed KMS key, you can use its key ID, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with \"alias/\". To specify a key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.
