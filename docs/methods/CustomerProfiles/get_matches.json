  "description": "Before calling this API, use CreateDomain or UpdateDomain to enable identity resolution: set Matching to true. GetMatches returns potentially matching profiles, based on the results of the latest run of a machine learning process. Amazon Connect uses the following profile attributes to identify matches: For example, two or more profiles--\u0094with spelling mistakes such as John Doe and Jhn Doe, or different casing email addresses such as JOHN_DOE@ANYCOMPANY.COM and johndoe@anycompany.com, or different phone number formats such as 555-010-0000 and +1-555-010-0000--\u0094can be detected as belonging to the same customer John Doe and merged into a unified profile.",

Given confidence scores vary as per the data input, it should not be used an absolute measure of matching quality.",
