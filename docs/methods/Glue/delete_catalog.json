  "description": "Removes the specified catalog from the Glue Data Catalog. After completing this operation, you no longer have access to the databases, tables (and all table versions and partitions that might belong to the tables) and the user-defined functions in the deleted catalog. Glue deletes these 'orphaned' resources asynchronously in a timely manner, at the discretion of the service. To ensure the immediate deletion of all related resources before calling the DeleteCatalog operation, use DeleteTableVersion (or BatchDeleteTableVersion), DeletePartition (or BatchDeletePartition), DeleteTable (or BatchDeleteTable), DeleteUserDefinedFunction and DeleteDatabase to delete any resources that belong to the catalog.",
