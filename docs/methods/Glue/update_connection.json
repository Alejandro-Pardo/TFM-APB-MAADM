The type of the connection. Currently, these types are supported: JDBC - Designates a connection to a database through Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). JDBC Connections use the following ConnectionParameters. Required: All of ( HOST, PORT, JDBC_ENGINE) or JDBC_CONNECTION_URL. Required: All of ( USERNAME, PASSWORD) or SECRET_ID. Optional: JDBC_ENFORCE_SSL, CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT, CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_STRING, SKIP_CUSTOM_JDBC_CERT_VALIDATION. These parameters are used to configure SSL with JDBC. KAFKA - Designates a connection to an Apache Kafka streaming platform. KAFKA Connections use the following ConnectionParameters. Required: KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS. Optional: KAFKA_SSL_ENABLED, KAFKA_CUSTOM_CERT, KAFKA_SKIP_CUSTOM_CERT_VALIDATION. These parameters are used to configure SSL with KAFKA. Optional: KAFKA_CLIENT_KEYSTORE, KAFKA_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD, KAFKA_CLIENT_KEY_PASSWORD, ENCRYPTED_KAFKA_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD, ENCRYPTED_KAFKA_CLIENT_KEY_PASSWORD. These parameters are used to configure TLS client configuration with SSL in KAFKA. Optional: KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM. Can be specified as SCRAM-SHA-512, GSSAPI, or AWS_MSK_IAM. Optional: KAFKA_SASL_SCRAM_USERNAME, KAFKA_SASL_SCRAM_PASSWORD, ENCRYPTED_KAFKA_SASL_SCRAM_PASSWORD. These parameters are used to configure SASL/SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication with KAFKA. Optional: KAFKA_SASL_GSSAPI_KEYTAB, KAFKA_SASL_GSSAPI_KRB5_CONF, KAFKA_SASL_GSSAPI_SERVICE, KAFKA_SASL_GSSAPI_PRINCIPAL. These parameters are used to configure SASL/GSSAPI authentication with KAFKA. MONGODB - Designates a connection to a MongoDB document database. MONGODB Connections use the following ConnectionParameters. Required: CONNECTION_URL. VIEW_VALIDATION_REDSHIFT - Designates a connection used for view validation by Amazon Redshift. VIEW_VALIDATION_ATHENA - Designates a connection used for view validation by Amazon Athena. NETWORK - Designates a network connection to a data source within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud environment (Amazon VPC). NETWORK Connections do not require ConnectionParameters. Instead, provide a PhysicalConnectionRequirements. MARKETPLACE - Uses configuration settings contained in a connector purchased from Amazon Web Services Marketplace to read from and write to data stores that are not natively supported by Glue. MARKETPLACE Connections use the following ConnectionParameters. Required: CONNECTOR_TYPE, CONNECTOR_URL, CONNECTOR_CLASS_NAME, CONNECTION_URL. Required for JDBC CONNECTOR_TYPE connections: All of ( USERNAME, PASSWORD) or SECRET_ID. CUSTOM - Uses configuration settings contained in a custom connector to read from and write to data stores that are not natively supported by Glue. Additionally, a ConnectionType for the following SaaS connectors is supported: FACEBOOKADS - Designates a connection to Facebook Ads. GOOGLEADS - Designates a connection to Google Ads. GOOGLESHEETS - Designates a connection to Google Sheets. GOOGLEANALYTICS4 - Designates a connection to Google Analytics 4. HUBSPOT - Designates a connection to HubSpot. INSTAGRAMADS - Designates a connection to Instagram Ads. INTERCOM - Designates a connection to Intercom. JIRACLOUD - Designates a connection to Jira Cloud.
