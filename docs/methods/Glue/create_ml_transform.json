Call this operation as the first step in the process of using a machine learning transform (such as the FindMatches transform) for deduplicating data. You can provide an optional Description, in addition to the parameters that you want to use for your algorithm. You must also specify certain parameters for the tasks that Glue runs on your behalf as part of learning from your data and creating a high-quality machine learning transform. These parameters include Role, and optionally, AllocatedCapacity, Timeout, and MaxRetries. For more information, see Jobs.",

For information about the types of machine learning transforms, see Creating Machine Learning Transforms. FindMatchesParameters (dict) --- The parameters for the find matches algorithm. PrimaryKeyColumnName (string) --- The name of a column that uniquely identifies rows in the source table. Used to help identify matching records. PrecisionRecallTradeoff (float) --- The value selected when tuning your transform for a balance between precision and recall. A value of 0.5 means no preference; a value of 1.0 means a bias purely for precision, and a value of 0.0 means a bias for recall. Because this is a tradeoff, choosing values close to 1.0 means very low recall, and choosing values close to 0.0 results in very low precision. The precision metric indicates how often your model is correct when it predicts a match. The recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how often your model predicts the match. AccuracyCostTradeoff (float) --- The value that is selected when tuning your transform for a balance between accuracy and cost. A value of 0.5 means that the system balances accuracy and cost concerns. A value of 1.0 means a bias purely for accuracy, which typically results in a higher cost, sometimes substantially higher. A value of 0.0 means a bias purely for cost, which results in a less accurate FindMatches transform, sometimes with unacceptable accuracy. Accuracy measures how well the transform finds true positives and true negatives. Increasing accuracy requires more machine resources and cost. But it also results in increased recall. Cost measures how many compute resources, and thus money, are consumed to run the transform. EnforceProvidedLabels (boolean) --- The value to switch on or off to force the output to match the provided labels from users. If the value is True, the find matches transform forces the output to match the provided labels. The results override the normal conflation results. If the value is False, the find matches transform does not ensure all the labels provided are respected, and the results rely on the trained model.
