Retention (integer) --- The retention time for this table. StorageDescriptor (dict) --- A storage descriptor containing information about the physical storage of this table. Columns (list) --- A list of the Columns in the table. (dict) --- A column in a Table. The name of the Column. Type (string) --- The data type of the Column. Comment (string) --- A free-form text comment. Parameters (dict) --- These key-value pairs define properties associated with the column. (string) --- (string) --- Location (string) --- The physical location of the table. By default, this takes the form of the warehouse location, followed by the database location in the warehouse, followed by the table name. AdditionalLocations (list) --- A list of locations that point to the path where a Delta table is located. (string) --- InputFormat (string) --- The input format: SequenceFileInputFormat (binary), or TextInputFormat, or a custom format. OutputFormat (string) --- The output format: SequenceFileOutputFormat (binary), or IgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat, or a custom format.

SerdeInfo (dict) --- The serialization/deserialization (SerDe) information. Name (string) --- Name of the SerDe. SerializationLibrary (string) --- Usually the class that implements the SerDe. An example is org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.columnar.ColumnarSerDe. Parameters (dict) --- These key-value pairs define initialization parameters for the SerDe.

(string) --- (string) --- StoredAsSubDirectories (boolean) --- True if the table data is stored in subdirectories, or False if not. SchemaReference (dict) --- An object that references a schema stored in the Glue Schema Registry. When creating a table, you can pass an empty list of columns for the schema, and instead use a schema reference. SchemaId (dict) --- A structure that contains schema identity fields. Either this or the SchemaVersionId has to be provided. SchemaArn (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the schema. One of SchemaArn or SchemaName has to be provided.

PartitionKeys (list) --- A list of columns by which the table is partitioned. Only primitive types are supported as partition keys.

If the table is a VIRTUAL_VIEW, certain Athena configuration encoded in base64. ViewExpandedText (string) --- Included for Apache Hive compatibility. TableType (string) --- The type of this table. Glue will create tables with the EXTERNAL_TABLE type. Other services, such as Athena, may create tables with additional table types. Glue related table types: EXTERNAL_TABLE Hive compatible attribute - indicates a non-Hive managed table. GOVERNED Used by Lake Formation. The Glue Data Catalog understands GOVERNED. Parameters (dict) --- These key-value pairs define properties associated with the table. (string) --- (string) --- TargetTable (dict) --- A TableIdentifier structure that describes a target table for resource linking.

ViewDefinition (dict) --- A structure that contains all the information that defines the view, including the dialect or dialects for the view, and the query. IsProtected (boolean) --- You can set this flag as true to instruct the engine not to push user-provided operations into the logical plan of the view during query planning. However, setting this flag does not guarantee that the engine will comply. Refer to the engine's documentation to understand the guarantees provided, if any. Definer (string) --- The definer of a view in SQL. Representations (list) --- A list of structures that contains the dialect of the view, and the query that defines the view. (dict) --- A structure containing details of a representation to update or create a Lake Formation view. Dialect (string) --- A parameter that specifies the engine type of a specific representation. DialectVersion (string) --- A parameter that specifies the version of the engine of a specific representation. ViewOriginalText (string) --- A string that represents the original SQL query that describes the view. ValidationConnection (string) --- The name of the connection to be used to validate the specific representation of the view. ViewExpandedText (string) --- A string that represents the SQL query that describes the view with expanded resource ARNs SubObjects (list) --- A list of base table ARNs that make up the view.
