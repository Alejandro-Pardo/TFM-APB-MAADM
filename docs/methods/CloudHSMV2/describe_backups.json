  "description": "Gets information about backups of CloudHSM clusters. Lists either the backups you own or the backups shared with you when the Shared parameter is true. This is a paginated operation, which means that each response might contain only a subset of all the backups. When the response contains only a subset of backups, it includes a NextToken value. Use this value in a subsequent DescribeBackups request to get more backups. When you receive a response with no NextToken (or an empty or null value), that means there are no more backups to get. Cross-account use: Yes. Customers can describe backups in other Amazon Web Services accounts that are shared with them.",
