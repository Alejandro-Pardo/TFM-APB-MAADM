  "description": "List routing control names and Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), as well as the routing control state for each routing control, along with the control panel name and control panel ARN for the routing controls. If you specify a control panel ARN, this call lists the routing controls in the control panel. Otherwise, it lists all the routing controls in the cluster. A routing control is a simple on/off switch in Route 53 ARC that you can use to route traffic to cells. When a routing control state is set to ON, traffic flows to a cell. When the state is set to OFF, traffic does not flow. Before you can create a routing control, you must first create a cluster, and then host the control in a control panel on the cluster. For more information, see Create routing control structures in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide. You access one of the endpoints for the cluster to get or update the routing control state to redirect traffic for your application. You must specify Regional endpoints when you work with API cluster operations to use this API operation to list routing controls in Route 53 ARC. Learn more about working with routing controls in the following topics in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide:",
