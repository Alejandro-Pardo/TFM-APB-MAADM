  "description": "Generates predictions for a group of observations. The observations to process exist in one or more data files referenced by a DataSource. This operation creates a new BatchPrediction, and uses an MLModel and the data files referenced by the DataSource as information sources. CreateBatchPrediction is an asynchronous operation. In response to CreateBatchPrediction, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns and sets the BatchPrediction status to PENDING. After the BatchPrediction completes, Amazon ML sets the status to COMPLETED. You can poll for status updates by using the  GetBatchPrediction operation and checking the Status parameter of the result. After the COMPLETED status appears, the results are available in the location specified by the OutputUri parameter.",
