  "description": "Lists all managed policies that are attached to the specified IAM role. An IAM role can also have inline policies embedded with it. To list the inline policies for a role, use  ListRolePolicies. For information about policies, see Managed policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide. You can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters. You can use the PathPrefix parameter to limit the list of policies to only those matching the specified path prefix. If there are no policies attached to the specified role (or none that match the specified path prefix), the operation returns an empty list.",
