  "description": "Creates a new version of the specified managed policy. To update a managed policy, you create a new policy version. A managed policy can have up to five versions. If the policy has five versions, you must delete an existing version using  DeletePolicyVersion before you create a new version. Optionally, you can set the new version as the policy's default version. The default version is the version that is in effect for the IAM users, groups, and roles to which the policy is attached.

The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see IAM and STS character quotas. The regex pattern used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following: Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character ( \\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through \\u00FF) The special characters tab ( \\u0009), line feed ( \\u000A), and carriage return ( \\u000D)",
