  "description": "Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM role. When you embed an inline policy in a role, the inline policy is used as part of the role's access (permissions) policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using CreateRole. You can update a role's trust policy using UpdateAssumeRolePolicy. For more information about roles, see IAM roles in the IAM User Guide. A role can also have a managed policy attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a role, use AttachRolePolicy. To create a new managed policy, use CreatePolicy. For information about policies, see Managed policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide. For information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed with a role, see IAM and STS quotas in the IAM User Guide.",
