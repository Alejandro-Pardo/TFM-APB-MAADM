      "description": "Used to select a set of devices. A filter is made up of an attribute, an operator, and one or more values. Attribute: The aspect of a device such as platform or model used as the selection criteria in a device filter. Allowed values include: ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device (for example, arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2::device:12345Example). PLATFORM: The device platform. Valid values are ANDROID or IOS. OS_VERSION: The operating system version (for example, 10.3.2). MODEL: The device model (for example, iPad 5th Gen). AVAILABILITY: The current availability of the device. Valid values are AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE. FORM_FACTOR: The device form factor. Valid values are PHONE or TABLET. MANUFACTURER: The device manufacturer (for example, Apple). REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for remote access. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for remote debugging. Because remote debugging is no longer supported, this attribute is ignored. INSTANCE_ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance. INSTANCE_LABELS: The label of the device instance. FLEET_TYPE: The fleet type. Valid values are PUBLIC or PRIVATE. Operator: The filter operator. The EQUALS operator is available for every attribute except INSTANCE_LABELS. The CONTAINS operator is available for the INSTANCE_LABELS and MODEL attributes. The IN and NOT_IN operators are available for the ARN, OS_VERSION, MODEL, MANUFACTURER, and INSTANCE_ARN attributes. The LESS_THAN, GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS, and GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS operators are also available for the OS_VERSION attribute. Values: An array of one or more filter values. The IN and NOT_IN operators take a values array that has one or more elements. The other operators require an array with a single element. In a request, the AVAILABILITY attribute takes the following values: AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE. (dict) --- Represents a device filter used to select a set of devices to be included in a test run. This data structure is passed in as the deviceSelectionConfiguration parameter to ScheduleRun. For an example of the JSON request syntax, see  ScheduleRun. It is also passed in as the filters parameter to ListDevices. For an example of the JSON request syntax, see  ListDevices. The aspect of a device such as platform or model used as the selection criteria in a device filter. The supported operators for each attribute are provided in the following list. ARN The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device (for example, arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2::device:12345Example). Supported operators: EQUALS, IN, NOT_IN PLATFORM The device platform. Supported operators: EQUALS OS_VERSION The operating system version (for example, 10.3.2). Supported operators: EQUALS, GREATER_THAN, GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS, IN, LESS_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS, NOT_IN MODEL The device model (for example, iPad 5th Gen). Supported operators: CONTAINS, EQUALS, IN, NOT_IN AVAILABILITY The current availability of the device. Supported operators: EQUALS FORM_FACTOR The device form factor. Supported operators: EQUALS MANUFACTURER The device manufacturer (for example, Apple). Supported operators: EQUALS, IN, NOT_IN REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED Whether the device is enabled for remote access. Supported operators: EQUALS REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED Whether the device is enabled for remote debugging. Supported operators: EQUALS Because remote debugging is no longer supported, this filter is ignored. INSTANCE_ARN The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance. Supported operators: EQUALS, IN, NOT_IN INSTANCE_LABELS The label of the device instance. Supported operators: CONTAINS FLEET_TYPE The fleet type. Supported operators: EQUALS Specifies how Device Farm compares the filter's attribute to the value. See the attribute descriptions. An array of one or more filter values used in a device filter. The IN and NOT_IN operators can take a values array that has more than one element. The PLATFORM attribute can be set to ANDROID or IOS. The AVAILABILITY attribute can be set to AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE. The FORM_FACTOR attribute can be set to PHONE or TABLET.
