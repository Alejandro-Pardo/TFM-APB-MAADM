  "description": "Deletes a member. Deleting a member removes the member and all associated resources from the network. DeleteMember can only be called for a specified MemberId if the principal performing the action is associated with the Amazon Web Services account that owns the member. In all other cases, the DeleteMember action is carried out as the result of an approved proposal to remove a member. If MemberId is the last member in a network specified by the last Amazon Web Services account, the network is deleted also. Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.",
