If you want a single dataset project, specify train for the value of DatasetType. To have a project with separate training and test datasets, call CreateDataset twice. On the first call, specify train for the value of DatasetType. On the second call, specify test for the value of DatasetType.

If you don't supply a value for ClientToken, the AWS SDK you are using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network error from making multiple dataset creation requests.
