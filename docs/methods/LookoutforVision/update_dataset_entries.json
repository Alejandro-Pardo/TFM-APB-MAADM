  "description": "Adds or updates one or more JSON Line entries in a dataset. A JSON Line includes information about an image used for training or testing an Amazon Lookout for Vision model. To update an existing JSON Line, use the source-ref field to identify the JSON Line. The JSON line that you supply replaces the existing JSON line. Any existing annotations that are not in the new JSON line are removed from the dataset. For more information, see Defining JSON lines for anomaly classification in the Amazon Lookout for Vision Developer Guide. Updating a dataset might take a while to complete. To check the current status, call  DescribeDataset and check the Status field in the response. This operation requires permissions to perform the lookoutvision:UpdateDatasetEntries operation.",

For example, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from UpdateDatasetEntries. In this case, safely retry your call to UpdateDatasetEntries by using the same ClientToken parameter value. If you don't supply a value for ClientToken, the AWS SDK you are using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network error from making multiple updates with the same dataset entries. You'll need to provide your own value for other use cases. An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for ClientToken is considered a new call to UpdateDatasetEntries. An idempotency token is active for 8 hours. This field is autopopulated if not provided.",
