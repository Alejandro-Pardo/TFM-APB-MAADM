To delete a model use the  DeleteModel operation. You also have to delete the dataset(s) associated with the model. For more information, see  DeleteDataset. The images referenced by the training and test datasets aren't deleted. This operation requires permissions to perform the lookoutvision:DeleteProject operation.",

For example, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from DeleteProject. In this case, safely retry your call to DeleteProject by using the same ClientToken parameter value. If you don't supply a value for ClientToken, the AWS SDK you are using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network error from making multiple project deletion requests. You'll need to provide your own value for other use cases. An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for ClientToken is considered a new call to DeleteProject. An idempotency token is active for 8 hours. This field is autopopulated if not provided.",
