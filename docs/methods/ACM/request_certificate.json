  "description": "Requests an ACM certificate for use with other Amazon Web Services services. To request an ACM certificate, you must specify a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the DomainName parameter. You can also specify additional FQDNs in the SubjectAlternativeNames parameter. If you are requesting a private certificate, domain validation is not required. If you are requesting a public certificate, each domain name that you specify must be validated to verify that you own or control the domain. You can use DNS validation or email validation. We recommend that you use DNS validation. ACM issues public certificates after receiving approval from the domain owner. After successful completion of the RequestCertificate action, there is a delay of several seconds before you can retrieve information about the new certificate.",

For example, add the name www.example.net to a certificate for which the DomainName field is www.example.com if users can reach your site by using either name. The maximum number of domain names that you can add to an ACM certificate is 100. However, the initial quota is 10 domain names. If you need more than 10 names, you must request a quota increase. For more information, see Quotas. The maximum length of a SAN DNS name is 253 octets. The name is made up of multiple labels separated by periods. No label can be longer than 63 octets. Consider the following examples: (63 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets) is legal because the total length is 253 octets (63+1+63+1+63+1+61) and no label exceeds 63 octets. (64 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets) is not legal because the total length exceeds 253 octets (64+1+63+1+63+1+61) and the first label exceeds 63 octets.
