The URI can point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for a collection of data files. For example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix, if the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input. InputFormat (string) --- Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed: ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing large documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers. ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing many short documents, such as text messages. DocumentReaderConfig (dict) --- Provides configuration parameters to override the default actions for extracting text from PDF documents and image files. This field defines the Amazon Textract API operation that Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF files and image files. Enter one of the following values: TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT - The Amazon Comprehend service uses the DetectDocumentText API operation. TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT - The Amazon Comprehend service uses the AnalyzeDocument API operation. DocumentReadMode (string) --- Determines the text extraction actions for PDF files. Enter one of the following values: SERVICE_DEFAULT - use the Amazon Comprehend service defaults for PDF files. FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION - Amazon Comprehend uses the Textract API specified by DocumentReadAction for all PDF files, including digital PDF files. FeatureTypes (list) --- Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features to apply. If you chose TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as the read action, you must specify one or both of the following values: TABLES - Returns additional information about any tables that are detected in the input document. FORMS - Returns additional information about any forms that are detected in the input document. (string) --- TABLES or FORMS.",
