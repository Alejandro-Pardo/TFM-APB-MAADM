      "description": "Specifies the format and location of the input data for the job. DataFormat (string) --- The format of your training data: COMPREHEND_CSV: A two-column CSV file, where labels are provided in the first column, and documents are provided in the second. If you use this value, you must provide the S3Uri parameter in your request. AUGMENTED_MANIFEST: A labeled dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in JSON lines format. Each line is a complete JSON object that contains a training document and its associated labels. If you use this value, you must provide the AugmentedManifests parameter in your request. If you don't specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses COMPREHEND_CSV as the default. S3Uri (string) --- The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for a collection of input files. For example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix, if the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input. This parameter is required if you set DataFormat to COMPREHEND_CSV. TestS3Uri (string) --- This specifies the Amazon S3 location that contains the test annotations for the document classifier. The URI must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. LabelDelimiter (string) --- Indicates the delimiter used to separate each label for training a multi-label classifier. The default delimiter between labels is a pipe (|). You can use a different character as a delimiter (if it's an allowed character) by specifying it under Delimiter for labels. If the training documents use a delimiter other than the default or the delimiter you specify, the labels on that line will be combined to make a single unique label, such as LABELLABELLABEL. AugmentedManifests (list) --- A list of augmented manifest files that provide training data for your custom model. An augmented manifest file is a labeled dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This parameter is required if you set DataFormat to AUGMENTED_MANIFEST. (dict) --- An augmented manifest file that provides training data for your custom model. The Amazon S3 location of the augmented manifest file. Split (string) --- The purpose of the data you've provided in the augmented manifest. You can either train or test this data. If you don't specify, the default is train. TRAIN - all of the documents in the manifest will be used for training. If no test documents are provided, Amazon Comprehend will automatically reserve a portion of the training documents for testing. TEST - all of the documents in the manifest will be used for testing. The JSON attribute that contains the annotations for your training documents. The number of attribute names that you specify depends on whether your augmented manifest file is the output of a single labeling job or a chained labeling job. If your file is the output of a single labeling job, specify the LabelAttributeName key that was used when the job was created in Ground Truth. If your file is the output of a chained labeling job, specify the LabelAttributeName key for one or more jobs in the chain. Each LabelAttributeName key provides the annotations from an individual job. (string) --- AnnotationDataS3Uri (string) --- The S3 prefix to the annotation files that are referred in the augmented manifest file. SourceDocumentsS3Uri (string) --- The S3 prefix to the source files (PDFs) that are referred to in the augmented manifest file. DocumentType (string) --- The type of augmented manifest. PlainTextDocument or SemiStructuredDocument. If you don't specify, the default is PlainTextDocument. PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT A document type that represents any unicode text that is encoded in UTF-8. SEMI_STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT A document type with positional and structural context, like a PDF. For training with Amazon Comprehend, only PDFs are supported. For inference, Amazon Comprehend support PDFs, DOCX and TXT. DocumentType (string) --- The type of input documents for training the model. Provide plain-text documents to create a plain-text model, and provide semi-structured documents to create a native document model. Documents (dict) --- The S3 location of the training documents. This parameter is required in a request to create a native document model. The S3 URI location of the training documents specified in the S3Uri CSV file. TestS3Uri (string) --- The S3 URI location of the test documents included in the TestS3Uri CSV file. This field is not required if you do not specify a test CSV file. DocumentReaderConfig (dict) --- Provides configuration parameters to override the default actions for extracting text from PDF documents and image files. By default, Amazon Comprehend performs the following actions to extract text from files, based on the input file type: Word files - Amazon Comprehend parser extracts the text. Digital PDF files - Amazon Comprehend parser extracts the text. Image files and scanned PDF files - Amazon Comprehend uses the Amazon Textract DetectDocumentText API to extract the text. DocumentReaderConfig does not apply to plain text files or Word files. For image files and PDF documents, you can override these default actions using the fields listed below. For more information, see Setting text extraction options in the Comprehend Developer Guide. This field defines the Amazon Textract API operation that Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF files and image files. Enter one of the following values: TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT - The Amazon Comprehend service uses the DetectDocumentText API operation. TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT - The Amazon Comprehend service uses the AnalyzeDocument API operation. DocumentReadMode (string) --- Determines the text extraction actions for PDF files. Enter one of the following values: SERVICE_DEFAULT - use the Amazon Comprehend service defaults for PDF files. FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION - Amazon Comprehend uses the Textract API specified by DocumentReadAction for all PDF files, including digital PDF files. FeatureTypes (list) --- Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features to apply. If you chose TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as the read action, you must specify one or both of the following values: TABLES - Returns additional information about any tables that are detected in the input document. FORMS - Returns additional information about any forms that are detected in the input document. (string) --- TABLES or FORMS.",
