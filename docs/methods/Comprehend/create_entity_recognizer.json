DataFormat (string) --- The format of your training data: COMPREHEND_CSV: A CSV file that supplements your training documents. The CSV file contains information about the custom entities that your trained model will detect. The required format of the file depends on whether you are providing annotations or an entity list. If you use this value, you must provide your CSV file by using either the Annotations or EntityList parameters. You must provide your training documents by using the Documents parameter. AUGMENTED_MANIFEST: A labeled dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in JSON lines format. Each line is a complete JSON object that contains a training document and its labels. Each label annotates a named entity in the training document. If you use this value, you must provide the AugmentedManifests parameter in your request. If you don't specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses COMPREHEND_CSV as the default. The entity types in the labeled training data that Amazon Comprehend uses to train the custom entity recognizer. Any entity types that you don't specify are ignored. A maximum of 25 entity types can be used at one time to train an entity recognizer.

TestS3Uri (string) --- Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the test documents for an entity recognizer are located. The URI must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. InputFormat (string) --- Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed. This is optional, and the default is ONE_DOC_PER_LINE. ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing large documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers. ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing many short documents, such as text messages. Annotations (dict) --- The S3 location of the CSV file that annotates your training documents. Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the annotations for an entity recognizer are located. TestS3Uri (string) --- Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the test annotations for an entity recognizer are located. EntityList (dict) --- The S3 location of the CSV file that has the entity list for your custom entity recognizer. Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the entity list is located.

An augmented manifest file is a labeled dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This parameter is required if you set DataFormat to AUGMENTED_MANIFEST.

The JSON attribute that contains the annotations for your training documents. The number of attribute names that you specify depends on whether your augmented manifest file is the output of a single labeling job or a chained labeling job. If your file is the output of a single labeling job, specify the LabelAttributeName key that was used when the job was created in Ground Truth. If your file is the output of a chained labeling job, specify the LabelAttributeName key for one or more jobs in the chain. Each LabelAttributeName key provides the annotations from an individual job. (string) --- AnnotationDataS3Uri (string) --- The S3 prefix to the annotation files that are referred in the augmented manifest file. SourceDocumentsS3Uri (string) --- The S3 prefix to the source files (PDFs) that are referred to in the augmented manifest file. DocumentType (string) --- The type of augmented manifest. PlainTextDocument or SemiStructuredDocument. If you don't specify, the default is PlainTextDocument. PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT A document type that represents any unicode text that is encoded in UTF-8.
