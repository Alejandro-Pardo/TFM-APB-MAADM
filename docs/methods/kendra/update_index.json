      "description": "The document metadata configuration you want to update for the index. Document metadata are fields or attributes associated with your documents. For example, the company department name associated with each document. (dict) --- Specifies the properties, such as relevance tuning and searchability, of an index field. The name of the index field. The data type of the index field. Relevance (dict) --- Provides tuning parameters to determine how the field affects the search results. Freshness (boolean) --- Indicates that this field determines how 'fresh' a document is. For example, if document 1 was created on November 5, and document 2 was created on October 31, document 1 is 'fresher' than document 2. Only applies to DATE fields. Importance (integer) --- The relative importance of the field in the search. Larger numbers provide more of a boost than smaller numbers. Duration (string) --- Specifies the time period that the boost applies to. For example, to make the boost apply to documents with the field value within the last month, you would use '2628000s'. Once the field value is beyond the specified range, the effect of the boost drops off. The higher the importance, the faster the effect drops off. If you don't specify a value, the default is 3 months. The value of the field is a numeric string followed by the character 's', for example '86400s' for one day, or '604800s' for one week. RankOrder (string) --- Determines how values should be interpreted. When the RankOrder field is ASCENDING, higher numbers are better. For example, a document with a rating score of 10 is higher ranking than a document with a rating score of 1. When the RankOrder field is DESCENDING, lower numbers are better. For example, in a task tracking application, a priority 1 task is more important than a priority 5 task. Only applies to LONG fields. ValueImportanceMap (dict) --- A list of values that should be given a different boost when they appear in the result list. For example, if you are boosting a field called 'department', query terms that match the department field are boosted in the result. However, you can add entries from the department field to boost documents with those values higher. For example, you can add entries to the map with names of departments. If you add 'HR',5 and 'Legal',3 those departments are given special attention when they appear in the metadata of a document. When those terms appear they are given the specified importance instead of the regular importance for the boost. (string) --- (integer) --- Search (dict) --- Provides information about how the field is used during a search. Facetable (boolean) --- Indicates that the field can be used to create search facets, a count of results for each value in the field. The default is false . Searchable (boolean) --- Determines whether the field is used in the search. If the Searchable field is true, you can use relevance tuning to manually tune how Amazon Kendra weights the field in the search. The default is true for string fields and false for number and date fields. Displayable (boolean) --- Determines whether the field is returned in the query response. The default is true. Sortable (boolean) --- Determines whether the field can be used to sort the results of a query. If you specify sorting on a field that does not have Sortable set to true, Amazon Kendra returns an exception. The default is false.",
