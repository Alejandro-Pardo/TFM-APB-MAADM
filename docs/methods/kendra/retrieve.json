  "description": "Retrieves relevant passages or text excerpts given an input query. This API is similar to the Query API. However, by default, the Query API only returns excerpt passages of up to 100 token words. With the Retrieve API, you can retrieve longer passages of up to 200 token words and up to 100 semantically relevant passages. This doesn't include question-answer or FAQ type responses from your index. The passages are text excerpts that can be semantically extracted from multiple documents and multiple parts of the same document. If in extreme cases your documents produce zero passages using the Retrieve API, you can alternatively use the Query API and its types of responses. You can also do the following: You can also include certain fields in the response that might provide useful additional information. The Retrieve API shares the number of query capacity units that you set for your index. For more information on what's included in a single capacity unit and the default base capacity for an index, see Adjusting capacity.",

      "description": "Filters search results by document fields/attributes. You can only provide one attribute filter; however, the AndAllFilters, NotFilter, and OrAllFilters parameters contain a list of other filters. The AttributeFilter parameter means you can create a set of filtering rules that a document must satisfy to be included in the query results. AndAllFilters (list) --- Performs a logical AND operation on all filters that you specify. (dict) --- Filters the search results based on document attributes or fields. You can filter results using attributes for your particular documents. The attributes must exist in your index. For example, if your documents include the custom attribute 'Department', you can filter documents that belong to the 'HR' department. You would use the EqualsTo operation to filter results or documents with 'Department' equals to 'HR'. You can use AndAllFilters and OrAllFilters in combination with each other or with other operations such as EqualsTo. For example: AndAllFilters EqualsTo: 'Department', 'HR' OrAllFilters ContainsAny: 'Project Name', ['new hires', 'new hiring'] This example filters results or documents that belong to the HR department AND belong to projects that contain 'new hires' OR 'new hiring' in the project name (must use ContainAny with StringListValue). This example is filtering with a depth of 2. You cannot filter more than a depth of 2, otherwise you receive a ValidationException exception with the message 'AttributeFilter cannot have a depth of more than 2.' Also, if you use more than 10 attribute filters in a given list for AndAllFilters or OrAllFilters, you receive a ValidationException with the message 'AttributeFilter cannot have a length of more than 10'. For examples of using AttributeFilter, see Using document attributes to filter search results. OrAllFilters (list) --- Performs a logical OR operation on all filters that you specify. NotFilter (dict) --- Performs a logical NOT operation on all filters that you specify. EqualsTo (dict) --- Performs an equals operation on document attributes/fields and their values. The identifier for the attribute. The value of the attribute. StringValue (string) --- A string, such as 'department'. StringListValue (list) --- A list of strings. The default maximum length or number of strings is 10. (string) --- LongValue (integer) --- A long integer value. DateValue (datetime) --- A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string. It is important for the time zone to be included in the ISO 8601 date-time format. For example, 2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00 is the ISO 8601 date-time format for March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time. ContainsAll (dict) --- Returns true when a document contains all of the specified document attributes/fields. This filter is only applicable to StringListValue. ContainsAny (dict) --- Returns true when a document contains any of the specified document attributes/fields. GreaterThan (dict) --- Performs a greater than operation on document attributes/fields and their values. Use with the document attribute type Date or Long. GreaterThanOrEquals (dict) --- Performs a greater or equals than operation on document attributes/fields and their values. LessThan (dict) --- Performs a less than operation on document attributes/fields and their values. LessThanOrEquals (dict) --- Performs a less than or equals operation on document attributes/fields and their values. For example, 2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00 is the ISO 8601 date-time format for March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time.",

If you use this API to override the relevance tuning configured at the index level, but there is no relevance tuning configured at the index level, then Amazon Kendra does not apply any relevance tuning. If there is relevance tuning configured for fields at the index level, and you use this API to override only some of these fields, then for the fields you did not override, the importance is set to 1. (dict) --- Overrides the document relevance properties of a custom index field. The name of the index field. Provides information for tuning the relevance of a field in a search. When a query includes terms that match the field, the results are given a boost in the response based on these tuning parameters. Freshness (boolean) --- Indicates that this field determines how 'fresh' a document is. For example, if document 1 was created on November 5, and document 2 was created on October 31, document 1 is 'fresher' than document 2. Only applies to DATE fields. Importance (integer) --- The relative importance of the field in the search. Larger numbers provide more of a boost than smaller numbers. Duration (string) --- Specifies the time period that the boost applies to. For example, to make the boost apply to documents with the field value within the last month, you would use '2628000s'. Once the field value is beyond the specified range, the effect of the boost drops off. The higher the importance, the faster the effect drops off. If you don't specify a value, the default is 3 months. The value of the field is a numeric string followed by the character 's', for example '86400s' for one day, or '604800s' for one week. RankOrder (string) --- Determines how values should be interpreted. When the RankOrder field is ASCENDING, higher numbers are better. For example, a document with a rating score of 10 is higher ranking than a document with a rating score of 1. When the RankOrder field is DESCENDING, lower numbers are better. For example, in a task tracking application, a priority 1 task is more important than a priority 5 task. Only applies to LONG fields. ValueImportanceMap (dict) --- A list of values that should be given a different boost when they appear in the result list. For example, if you are boosting a field called 'department', query terms that match the department field are boosted in the result. However, you can add entries from the department field to boost documents with those values higher. For example, you can add entries to the map with names of departments. If you add 'HR',5 and 'Legal',3 those departments are given special attention when they appear in the metadata of a document.
