For more information on how to create, modify and delete document metadata, or make other content alterations when you ingest documents into Amazon Kendra, see Customizing document metadata during the ingestion process. InlineConfigurations (list) --- Configuration information to alter document attributes or metadata fields and content when ingesting documents into Amazon Kendra. (dict) --- Provides the configuration information for applying basic logic to alter document metadata and content when ingesting documents into Amazon Kendra. To apply advanced logic, to go beyond what you can do with basic logic, see HookConfiguration. For more information, see Customizing document metadata during the ingestion process. Condition (dict) --- Configuration of the condition used for the target document attribute or metadata field when ingesting documents into Amazon Kendra. The identifier of the document attribute used for the condition. For example, --\u0098Source_URI' could be an identifier for the attribute or metadata field that contains source URIs associated with the documents. Amazon Kendra currently does not support _document_body as an attribute key used for the condition. The condition operator. For example, you can use --\u0098Contains' to partially match a string. ConditionOnValue (dict) --- The value used by the operator. For example, you can specify the value --\u0098financial' for strings in the --\u0098Source_URI' field that partially match or contain this value. StringValue (string) --- A string, such as 'department'. StringListValue (list) --- A list of strings. The default maximum length or number of strings is 10. (string) --- LongValue (integer) --- A long integer value. DateValue (datetime) --- A date expressed as an ISO 8601 string. It is important for the time zone to be included in the ISO 8601 date-time format. For example, 2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00 is the ISO 8601 date-time format for March 25th 2012 at 12:30PM (plus 10 seconds) in Central European Time. Target (dict) --- Configuration of the target document attribute or metadata field when ingesting documents into Amazon Kendra. You can also include a value. TargetDocumentAttributeKey (string) --- The identifier of the target document attribute or metadata field. For example, --\u0098Department' could be an identifier for the target attribute or metadata field that includes the department names associated with the documents. TargetDocumentAttributeValueDeletion (boolean) --- TRUE to delete the existing target value for your specified target attribute key. You cannot create a target value and set this to TRUE. To create a target value ( TargetDocumentAttributeValue), set this to FALSE. TargetDocumentAttributeValue (dict) --- The target value you want to create for the target attribute. For example, --\u0098Finance' could be the target value for the target attribute key --\u0098Department'. DocumentContentDeletion (boolean) --- TRUE to delete content if the condition used for the target attribute is met. PreExtractionHookConfiguration (dict) --- Configuration information for invoking a Lambda function in Lambda on the original or raw documents before extracting their metadata and text. You can use a Lambda function to apply advanced logic for creating, modifying, or deleting document metadata and content. For more information, see Advanced data manipulation. InvocationCondition (dict) --- The condition used for when a Lambda function should be invoked. For example, you can specify a condition that if there are empty date-time values, then Amazon Kendra should invoke a function that inserts the current date-time. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role with permission to run a Lambda function during ingestion. For more information, see an IAM roles for Amazon Kendra. Stores the original, raw documents or the structured, parsed documents before and after altering them. For more information, see Data contracts for Lambda functions. PostExtractionHookConfiguration (dict) --- Configuration information for invoking a Lambda function in Lambda on the structured documents with their metadata and text extracted. RoleArn (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role with permission to run PreExtractionHookConfiguration and PostExtractionHookConfiguration for altering document metadata and content during the document ingestion process.
