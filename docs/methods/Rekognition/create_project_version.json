  "description": "Creates a new version of Amazon Rekognition project (like a Custom Labels model or a custom adapter) and begins training. Models and adapters are managed as part of a Rekognition project. The response from CreateProjectVersion is an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the project version. The FeatureConfig operation argument allows you to configure specific model or adapter settings. You can provide a description to the project version by using the VersionDescription argment. Training can take a while to complete. You can get the current status by calling  DescribeProjectVersions. Training completed successfully if the value of the Status field is TRAINING_COMPLETED. Once training has successfully completed, call  DescribeProjectVersions to get the training results and evaluate the model. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:CreateProjectVersion action.",
