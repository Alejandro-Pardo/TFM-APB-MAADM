  "description": "Adds or updates one or more entries (images) in a dataset. An entry is a JSON Line which contains the information for a single image, including the image location, assigned labels, and object location bounding boxes. For more information, see Image-Level labels in manifest files and Object localization in manifest files in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide. If the source-ref field in the JSON line references an existing image, the existing image in the dataset is updated. If source-ref field doesn't reference an existing image, the image is added as a new image to the dataset. You specify the changes that you want to make in the Changes input parameter. There isn't a limit to the number JSON Lines that you can change, but the size of Changes must be less than 5MB. UpdateDatasetEntries returns immediatly, but the dataset update might take a while to complete. Use  DescribeDataset to check the current status. The dataset updated successfully if the value of Status is UPDATE_COMPLETE. To check if any non-terminal errors occured, call  ListDatasetEntries and check for the presence of errors lists in the JSON Lines. Dataset update fails if a terminal error occurs ( Status = UPDATE_FAILED). Currently, you can't access the terminal error information from the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels SDK. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:UpdateDatasetEntries action.",
