  "description": "Removes the association between a Face supplied in an array of FaceIds and the User. If the User is not present already, then a ResourceNotFound exception is thrown. If successful, an array of faces that are disassociated from the User is returned. If a given face is already disassociated from the given UserID, it will be ignored and not be returned in the response. If a given face is already associated with a different User or not found in the collection it will be returned as part of UnsuccessfulDisassociations. You can remove 1 - 100 face IDs from a user at one time.",
