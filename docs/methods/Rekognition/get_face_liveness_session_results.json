Returns the corresponding Face Liveness confidence score, a reference image that includes a face bounding box, and audit images that also contain face bounding boxes. The Face Liveness confidence score ranges from 0 to 100. The number of audit images returned by GetFaceLivenessSessionResults is defined by the AuditImagesLimit paramater when calling CreateFaceLivenessSession. Reference images are always returned when possible.",
