  "description": "This API operation initiates a Face Liveness session. It returns a SessionId, which you can use to start streaming Face Liveness video and get the results for a Face Liveness session. You can use the OutputConfig option in the Settings parameter to provide an Amazon S3 bucket location. The Amazon S3 bucket stores reference images and audit images. If no Amazon S3 bucket is defined, raw bytes are sent instead. You can use AuditImagesLimit to limit the number of audit images returned when GetFaceLivenessSessionResults is called. This number is between 0 and 4. By default, it is set to 0. The limit is best effort and based on the duration of the selfie-video.",

OutputConfig (dict) --- Can specify the location of an Amazon S3 bucket, where reference and audit images will be stored. Note that the Amazon S3 bucket must be located in the caller's AWS account and in the same region as the Face Liveness end-point. Additionally, the Amazon S3 object keys are auto-generated by the Face Liveness system. Requires that the caller has the s3:PutObject permission on the Amazon S3 bucket. The path to an AWS Amazon S3 bucket used to store Face Liveness session results. S3KeyPrefix (string) --- The prefix prepended to the output files for the Face Liveness session results. AuditImagesLimit (integer) --- Number of audit images to be returned back. Takes an integer between 0-4. Any integer less than 0 will return 0, any integer above 4 will return 4 images in the response. By default, it is set to 0.
