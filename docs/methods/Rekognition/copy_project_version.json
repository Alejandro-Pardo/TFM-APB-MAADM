  "description": "Copies a version of an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model from a source project to a destination project. The source and destination projects can be in different AWS accounts but must be in the same AWS Region. You can't copy a model to another AWS service. To copy a model version to a different AWS account, you need to create a resource-based policy known as a project policy. You attach the project policy to the source project by calling  PutProjectPolicy. The project policy gives permission to copy the model version from a trusting AWS account to a trusted account. For more information creating and attaching a project policy, see Attaching a project policy (SDK) in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide. If you are copying a model version to a project in the same AWS account, you don't need to create a project policy. Copying a model version takes a while to complete. To get the current status, call  DescribeProjectVersions and check the value of Status in the  ProjectVersionDescription object. The copy operation has finished when the value of Status is COPYING_COMPLETED. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:CopyProjectVersion action.",
