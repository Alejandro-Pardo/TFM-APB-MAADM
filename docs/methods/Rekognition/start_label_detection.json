  "description": "Starts asynchronous detection of labels in a stored video. Amazon Rekognition Video can detect labels in a video. Labels are instances of real-world entities. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; concepts like landscape, evening, and nature; and activities like a person getting out of a car or a person skiing. The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use  Video to specify the bucket name and the filename of the video. StartLabelDetection returns a job identifier ( JobId) which you use to get the results of the operation. When label detection is finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in NotificationChannel. To get the results of the label detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call  GetLabelDetection and pass the job identifier ( JobId) from the initial call to StartLabelDetection. Optional Parameters. StartLabelDetection has the GENERAL_LABELS Feature applied by default. This feature allows you to provide filtering criteria to the Settings parameter. You can filter with sets of individual labels or with label categories. You can specify inclusive filters, exclusive filters, or a combination of inclusive and exclusive filters. For more information on filtering, see Detecting labels in a video. You can specify MinConfidence to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 50.",
