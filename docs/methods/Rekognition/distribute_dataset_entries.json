  "description": "Distributes the entries (images) in a training dataset across the training dataset and the test dataset for a project. DistributeDatasetEntries moves 20% of the training dataset images to the test dataset. An entry is a JSON Line that describes an image. You supply the Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of a project's training dataset and test dataset. The training dataset must contain the images that you want to split. The test dataset must be empty. The datasets must belong to the same project. To create training and test datasets for a project, call  CreateDataset. Distributing a dataset takes a while to complete. To check the status call DescribeDataset. The operation is complete when the Status field for the training dataset and the test dataset is UPDATE_COMPLETE. If the dataset split fails, the value of Status is UPDATE_FAILED. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:DistributeDatasetEntries action.",
