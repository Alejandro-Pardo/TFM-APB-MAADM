  "description": "Associates one or more faces with an existing UserID. Takes an array of FaceIds. Each FaceId that are present in the FaceIds list is associated with the provided UserID. The number of FaceIds that can be used as input in a single request is limited to 100. Note that the total number of faces that can be associated with a single UserID is also limited to 100. Once a UserID has 100 faces associated with it, no additional faces can be added. If more API calls are made after the limit is reached, a ServiceQuotaExceededException will result. The UserMatchThreshold parameter specifies the minimum user match confidence required for the face to be associated with a UserID that has at least one FaceID already associated. This ensures that the FaceIds are associated with the right UserID. The value ranges from 0-100 and default value is 75. If successful, an array of AssociatedFace objects containing the associated FaceIds is returned. If a given face is already associated with the given UserID, it will be ignored and will not be returned in the response. If a given face is already associated to a different UserID, isn't found in the collection, doesn't meet the UserMatchThreshold, or there are already 100 faces associated with the UserID, it will be returned as part of an array of UnsuccessfulFaceAssociations. The UserStatus reflects the status of an operation which updates a UserID representation with a list of given faces. The UserStatus can be:",
