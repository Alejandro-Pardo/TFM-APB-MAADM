  "description": "Attaches a project policy to a Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project in a trusting AWS account. A project policy specifies that a trusted AWS account can copy a model version from a trusting AWS account to a project in the trusted AWS account. To copy a model version you use the  CopyProjectVersion operation. Only applies to Custom Labels projects. For more information about the format of a project policy document, see Attaching a project policy (SDK) in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide. The response from PutProjectPolicy is a revision ID for the project policy. You can attach multiple project policies to a project. You can also update an existing project policy by specifying the policy revision ID of the existing policy. To remove a project policy from a project, call  DeleteProjectPolicy. To get a list of project policies attached to a project, call  ListProjectPolicies. You copy a model version by calling  CopyProjectVersion. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:PutProjectPolicy action.",
