  "description": "Creates a new User within a collection specified by CollectionId. Takes UserId as a parameter, which is a user provided ID which should be unique within the collection. The provided UserId will alias the system generated UUID to make the UserId more user friendly. Uses a ClientToken, an idempotency token that ensures a call to CreateUser completes only once. If the value is not supplied, the AWS SDK generates an idempotency token for the requests. This prevents retries after a network error results from making multiple CreateUser calls.",
