The resume-processing option isn't applicable for a full-load replication, because you can't resume partially loaded tables during the full load phase. For a full-load-and-cdc replication, DMS migrates table data, and then applies data changes that occur on the source. To load all the tables again, and start capturing source changes, use reload-target. Otherwise use resume-processing, to replicate the changes from the last stop position.",
