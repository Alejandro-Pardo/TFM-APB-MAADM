When creating objects, the system will provide you with the identifier of the created object. An object's identifier is immutable and no two objects will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an object with ObjectIdentifier, the ObjectIdentifier must be wrapped in double quotes. /some/path - Identifies the object based on path #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call.",
