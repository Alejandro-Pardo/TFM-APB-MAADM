Selector (string) --- A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the parent/child links leading to it from the directory root. Use the link names from each parent/child link to construct the path. Path selectors start with a slash (/) and link names are separated by slashes. For more information about paths, see Access Objects. You can identify an object in one of the following ways: $ObjectIdentifier - An object identifier is an opaque string provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the system will provide you with the identifier of the created object. An object's identifier is immutable and no two objects will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an object with ObjectIdentifier, the ObjectIdentifier must be wrapped in double quotes. /some/path - Identifies the object based on path #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call LinkName (string) --- The name of the link. BatchReferenceName (string) --- The batch reference name. See Transaction Support for more information. AttachObject (dict) --- Attaches an object to a  Directory. The parent object reference. /some/path - Identifies the object based on path #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call The child object reference that is to be attached to the object. /some/path - Identifies the object based on path #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call The name of the link.

Represents the facet being added to the object. The attributes to set on the object. A reference to the object being mutated. /some/path - Identifies the object based on path #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call RemoveFacetFromObject (dict) --- A batch operation that removes a facet from an object. The facet to remove from the object. A reference to the object whose facet will be removed. /some/path - Identifies the object based on path #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call AttachPolicy (dict) --- Attaches a policy object to a regular object. An object can have a limited number of attached policies. The reference that is associated with the policy object. /some/path - Identifies the object based on path #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call The reference that identifies the object to which the policy will be attached. /some/path - Identifies the object based on path #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call DetachPolicy (dict) --- Detaches a policy from a  Directory.

Indicates whether the attribute that is being indexed has unique values or not. ParentReference (dict) --- A reference to the parent object that contains the index object. /some/path - Identifies the object based on path #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call LinkName (string) --- The name of the link between the parent object and the index object. AttachToIndex (dict) --- Attaches the specified object to the specified index. A reference to the index that you are attaching the object to. /some/path - Identifies the object based on path #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call A reference to the object that you are attaching to the index. /some/path - Identifies the object based on path #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call DetachFromIndex (dict) --- Detaches the specified object from the specified index.
