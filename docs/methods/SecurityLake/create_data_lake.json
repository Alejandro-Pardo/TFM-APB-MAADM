  "description": "Initializes an Amazon Security Lake instance with the provided (or default) configuration. You can enable Security Lake in Amazon Web Services Regions with customized settings before enabling log collection in Regions. To specify particular Regions, configure these Regions using the configurations parameter. If you have already enabled Security Lake in a Region when you call this command, the command will update the Region if you provide new configuration parameters. If you have not already enabled Security Lake in the Region when you call this API, it will set up the data lake in the Region with the specified configurations. When you enable Security Lake, it starts ingesting security data after the CreateAwsLogSource call and after you create subscribers using the CreateSubscriber API. This includes ingesting security data from sources, storing data, and making data accessible to subscribers. Security Lake also enables all the existing settings and resources that it stores or maintains for your Amazon Web Services account in the current Region, including security log and event data. For more information, see the Amazon Security Lake User Guide.",
