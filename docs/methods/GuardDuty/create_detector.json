  "description": "Creates a single GuardDuty detector. A detector is a resource that represents the GuardDuty service. To start using GuardDuty, you must create a detector in each Region where you enable the service. You can have only one detector per account per Region. All data sources are enabled in a new detector by default. Specifying both EKS Runtime Monitoring ( EKS_RUNTIME_MONITORING) and Runtime Monitoring ( RUNTIME_MONITORING) will cause an error. You can add only one of these two features because Runtime Monitoring already includes the threat detection for Amazon EKS resources. For more information, see Runtime Monitoring. There might be regional differences because some data sources might not be available in all the Amazon Web Services Regions where GuardDuty is presently supported. For more information, see Regions and endpoints.",
