  "description": "Invites Amazon Web Services accounts to become members of an organization administered by the Amazon Web Services account that invokes this API. If you are using Amazon Web Services Organizations to manage your GuardDuty environment, this step is not needed. For more information, see Managing accounts with organizations. To invite Amazon Web Services accounts, the first step is to ensure that GuardDuty has been enabled in the potential member accounts. You can now invoke this API to add accounts by invitation. The invited accounts can either accept or decline the invitation from their GuardDuty accounts. Each invited Amazon Web Services account can choose to accept the invitation from only one Amazon Web Services account. For more information, see Managing GuardDuty accounts by invitation. After the invite has been accepted and you choose to disassociate a member account (by using DisassociateMembers) from your account, the details of the member account obtained by invoking CreateMembers, including the associated email addresses, will be retained. This is done so that you can invoke InviteMembers without the need to invoke CreateMembers again. To remove the details associated with a member account, you must also invoke DeleteMembers. If you disassociate a member account that was added by invitation, the member account details obtained from this API, including the associated email addresses, will be retained. This is done so that the delegated administrator can invoke the InviteMembers API without the need to invoke the CreateMembers API again. To remove the details associated with a member account, the delegated administrator must invoke the DeleteMembers API. When the member accounts added through Organizations are later disassociated, you (administrator) can't invite them by calling the InviteMembers API. You can create an association with these member accounts again only by calling the CreateMembers API.",
