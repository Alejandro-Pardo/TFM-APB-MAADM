Filters the results to include only those of the specified resource types. resource-type - Filter resources by their type. Specify up to five resource types in the format AWS::ServiceCode::ResourceType. For example, AWS::EC2::Instance, or AWS::S3::Bucket. When you specify a resource-type filter for ListGroupResources, Resource Groups validates your filter resource types against the types that are defined in the query associated with the group. For example, if a group contains only S3 buckets because its query specifies only that resource type, but your resource-type filter includes EC2 instances, AWS Resource Groups does not filter for EC2 instances. In this case, a ListGroupResources request returns a BadRequestException error with a message similar to the following: The resource types specified as filters in the request are not valid. The error includes a list of resource types that failed the validation because they are not part of the query associated with the group. This validation doesn't occur when the group query specifies AWS::AllSupported, because a group based on such a query can contain any of the allowed resource types for the query type (tag-based or Amazon CloudFront stack-based queries).
