After you bring an address range to Amazon Web Services, it appears in your account as an address pool. When you create an accelerator, you can assign one IPv4 address from your range to it. Global Accelerator assigns you a second static IPv4 address from an Amazon IP address range. If you bring two IPv4 address ranges to Amazon Web Services, you can assign one IPv4 address from each range to your accelerator. This restriction is because Global Accelerator assigns each address range to a different network zone, for high availability. You can specify one or two addresses, separated by a space. Do not include the /32 suffix. Note that you can't update IP addresses for an existing accelerator. To change them, you must create a new accelerator with the new addresses.
