EndpointId (string) --- An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID. For cross-account endpoints, this must be the ARN of the resource. Weight (integer) --- The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see Endpoint weights in the Global Accelerator Developer Guide. ClientIPPreservationEnabled (boolean) --- Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for Application Load Balancer endpoints. If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the X-Forwarded-For request header as traffic travels to applications on the endpoint fronted by the accelerator. Client IP address preservation is supported, in specific Amazon Web Services Regions, for endpoints that are Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, and Network Load Balancers with security groups. IMPORTANT: You cannot use client IP address preservation with Network Load Balancers with TLS listeners.
