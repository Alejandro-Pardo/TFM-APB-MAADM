  "description": "UpdateContinuousBackups enables or disables point in time recovery for the specified table. A successful UpdateContinuousBackups call returns the current ContinuousBackupsDescription. Continuous backups are ENABLED on all tables at table creation. If point in time recovery is enabled, PointInTimeRecoveryStatus will be set to ENABLED. Once continuous backups and point in time recovery are enabled, you can restore to any point in time within EarliestRestorableDateTime and LatestRestorableDateTime. LatestRestorableDateTime is typically 5 minutes before the current time. You can restore your table to any point in time in the last 35 days. You can set the RecoveryPeriodInDays to any value between 1 and 35 days.",
