The attributes of the table created as part of the import operation. (dict) --- Represents an attribute for describing the schema for the table and indexes. A name for the attribute. The data type for the attribute, where: S - the attribute is of type String N - the attribute is of type Number B - the attribute is of type Binary The primary key and option sort key of the table created as part of the import operation. (dict) --- Represents a single element of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index. A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one KeySchemaElement for the partition key, and another KeySchemaElement for the sort key. A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map. The name of a key attribute. The role that this key attribute will assume: HASH - partition key RANGE - sort key BillingMode (string) --- The billing mode for provisioning the table created as part of the import operation. ProvisionedThroughput (dict) --- Represents the provisioned throughput settings for the specified global secondary index. You must use ProvisionedThroughput or OnDemandThroughput based on your table's capacity mode. For current minimum and maximum provisioned throughput values, see Service, Account, and Table Quotas in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException. For more information, see Specifying Read and Write Requirements in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. If read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the value is set to 0. The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException. OnDemandThroughput (dict) --- Sets the maximum number of read and write units for the specified on-demand table. If you use this parameter, you must specify MaxReadRequestUnits, MaxWriteRequestUnits, or both. MaxReadRequestUnits (integer) --- Maximum number of read request units for the specified table. To specify a maximum OnDemandThroughput on your table, set the value of MaxReadRequestUnits as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum OnDemandThroughput that is currently set on your table, set the value of MaxReadRequestUnits to -1. MaxWriteRequestUnits (integer) --- Maximum number of write request units for the specified table. To specify a maximum OnDemandThroughput on your table, set the value of MaxWriteRequestUnits as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum OnDemandThroughput that is currently set on your table, set the value of MaxWriteRequestUnits to -1. SSESpecification (dict) --- Represents the settings used to enable server-side encryption. Enabled (boolean) --- Indicates whether server-side encryption is done using an Amazon Web Services managed key or an Amazon Web Services owned key. If enabled (true), server-side encryption type is set to KMS and an Amazon Web Services managed key is used (KMS charges apply). If disabled (false) or not specified, server-side encryption is set to Amazon Web Services owned key. SSEType (string) --- Server-side encryption type. The only supported value is: KMS - Server-side encryption that uses Key Management Service. The key is stored in your account and is managed by KMS (KMS charges apply). KMSMasterKeyId (string) --- The KMS key that should be used for the KMS encryption. To specify a key, use its key ID, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), alias name, or alias ARN. Note that you should only provide this parameter if the key is different from the default DynamoDB key alias/aws/dynamodb. GlobalSecondaryIndexes (list) --- The Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) of the table to be created as part of the import operation. (dict) --- Represents the properties of a global secondary index. The name of the global secondary index. The name must be unique among all other indexes on this table. The complete key schema for a global secondary index, which consists of one or more pairs of attribute names and key types: HASH - partition key RANGE - sort key (dict) --- Represents a single element of a key schema. The role that this key attribute will assume: HASH - partition key RANGE - sort key Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the global secondary index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected. ProjectionType (string) --- The set of attributes that are projected into the index: KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index. INCLUDE - In addition to the attributes described in KEYS_ONLY, the secondary index will include other non-key attributes that you specify. ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into the index. When using the DynamoDB console, ALL is selected by default. NonKeyAttributes (list) --- Represents the non-key attribute names which will be projected into the index. For global and local secondary indexes, the total count of NonKeyAttributes summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total. This limit only applies when you specify the ProjectionType of INCLUDE. You still can specify the ProjectionType of ALL to project all attributes from the source table, even if the table has more than 100 attributes. (string) --- ProvisionedThroughput (dict) --- Represents the provisioned throughput settings for the specified global secondary index. You must use either OnDemandThroughput or ProvisionedThroughput based on your table's capacity mode. OnDemandThroughput (dict) --- The maximum number of read and write units for the specified global secondary index. WarmThroughput (dict) --- Represents the warm throughput value (in read units per second and write units per second) for the specified secondary index. If you use this parameter, you must specify ReadUnitsPerSecond, WriteUnitsPerSecond, or both. ReadUnitsPerSecond (integer) --- Represents the number of read operations your base table can instantaneously support. WriteUnitsPerSecond (integer) --- Represents the number of write operations your base table can instantaneously support.",
