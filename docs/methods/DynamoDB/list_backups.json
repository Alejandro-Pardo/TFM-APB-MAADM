  "description": "List DynamoDB backups that are associated with an Amazon Web Services account and weren't made with Amazon Web Services Backup. To list these backups for a given table, specify TableName. ListBackups returns a paginated list of results with at most 1 MB worth of items in a page. You can also specify a maximum number of entries to be returned in a page. In the request, start time is inclusive, but end time is exclusive. Note that these boundaries are for the time at which the original backup was requested. You can call ListBackups a maximum of five times per second. If you want to retrieve the complete list of backups made with Amazon Web Services Backup, use the Amazon Web Services Backup list API.",
