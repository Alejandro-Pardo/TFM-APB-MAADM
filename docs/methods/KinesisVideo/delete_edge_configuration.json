  "description": "An asynchronous API that deletes a stream's existing edge configuration, as well as the corresponding media from the Edge Agent. When you invoke this API, the sync status is set to DELETING. A deletion process starts, in which active edge jobs are stopped and all media is deleted from the edge device. The time to delete varies, depending on the total amount of stored media. If the deletion process fails, the sync status changes to DELETE_FAILED. You will need to re-try the deletion. When the deletion process has completed successfully, the edge configuration is no longer accessible.",
