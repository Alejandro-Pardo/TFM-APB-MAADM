  "description": "Uploads a part in a multipart upload. You must initiate a multipart upload (see CreateMultipartUpload) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request. Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see Multipart upload limits in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information on multipart uploads, go to Multipart Upload Overview in the *Amazon S3 User Guide *. General purpose bucket - To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, specify the Content-MD5 header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the x-amz-content-sha256 header as a checksum instead of Content-MD5. For more information see Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4). For more information, see Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com.

      "description": "The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated. Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3 (for example, amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Access points - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User Guide.",
