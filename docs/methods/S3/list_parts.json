  "description": "Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload. To use this operation, you must provide the upload ID in the request. You obtain this uploadID by sending the initiate multipart upload request through CreateMultipartUpload. The ListParts request returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The limit of 1,000 parts is also the default value. You can restrict the number of parts in a response by specifying the max-parts request parameter. If your multipart upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an IsTruncated field with the value of true, and a NextPartNumberMarker element. To list remaining uploaded parts, in subsequent ListParts requests, include the part-number-marker query string parameter and set its value to the NextPartNumberMarker field value from the previous response. For more information on multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. The following operations are related to ListParts:",

Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3 (for example, amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Access points - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User Guide.",
