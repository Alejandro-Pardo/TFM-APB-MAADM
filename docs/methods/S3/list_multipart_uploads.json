  "description": "This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads in a bucket. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated by the CreateMultipartUpload request, but has not yet been completed or aborted. The ListMultipartUploads operation returns a maximum of 1,000 multipart uploads in the response. The limit of 1,000 multipart uploads is also the default value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a response by specifying the max-uploads request parameter. If there are more than 1,000 multipart uploads that satisfy your ListMultipartUploads request, the response returns an IsTruncated element with the value of true, a NextKeyMarker element, and a NextUploadIdMarker element. To list the remaining multipart uploads, you need to make subsequent ListMultipartUploads requests. In these requests, include two query parameters: key-marker and upload-id-marker. Set the value of key-marker to the NextKeyMarker value from the previous response. Similarly, set the value of upload-id-marker to the NextUploadIdMarker value from the previous response. For more information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. The following operations are related to ListMultipartUploads:",

Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3 (for example, amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Access points - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User Guide.",
