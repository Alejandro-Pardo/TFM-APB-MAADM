  "description": "Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists (ACL). For more information, see Using ACLs. To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have the WRITE_ACP permission. You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions: Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach. You can set access permissions by using one of the following methods: For example, the following x-amz-grant-write header grants create, overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses. x-amz-grant-write: uri=\"http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery\", id=\"111122223333\", id=\"555566667777\" You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both. You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways. For examples of how to specify these grantee values in JSON format, see the Amazon Web Services CLI example in Enabling Amazon S3 server access logging in the Amazon S3 User Guide. The following operations are related to PutBucketAcl:",
