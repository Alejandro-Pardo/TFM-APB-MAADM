      "description": "Conditional rules that are evaluated for determining actions on email. (dict) --- A rule contains conditions, 'unless conditions' and actions. For each envelope recipient of an email, if all conditions match and none of the 'unless conditions' match, then all of the actions are executed sequentially. If no conditions are provided, the rule always applies and the actions are implicitly executed. If only 'unless conditions' are provided, the rule applies if the email does not match the evaluation of the 'unless conditions'. The list of actions to execute when the conditions match the incoming email, and none of the 'unless conditions' match. (dict) --- The action for a rule to take. Only one of the contained actions can be set. AddHeader (dict) --- This action adds a header. This can be used to add arbitrary email headers. The name of the header to add to an email.

Drop (dict) --- This action terminates the evaluation of rules in the rule set. PublishToSns (dict) --- This action publishes the email content to an Amazon SNS topic. For example, specified SNS topic has been deleted or the role lacks necessary permissions to call the sns:Publish API. Encoding (string) --- The encoding to use for the email within the Amazon SNS notification. The default value is UTF-8. Use BASE64 if you need to preserve all special characters, especially when the original message uses a different encoding format. PayloadType (string) --- The expected payload type within the Amazon SNS notification. CONTENT attempts to publish the full email content with 20KB of headers content. HEADERS extracts up to 100KB of header content to include in the notification, email content will not be included to the notification. The default value is CONTENT. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM Role to use while writing to Amazon SNS. This role must have access to the sns:Publish API for the given topic. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS Topic to which notification for the email received will be published. Relay (dict) --- This action relays the email to another SMTP server. For example, the specified relay has been deleted. MailFrom (string) --- This action specifies whether to preserve or replace original mail from address while relaying received emails to a destination server.

For example, the caller does not have the permissions to call the sendRawEmail API. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to use for this action. This role must have access to the ses:SendRawEmail API. WriteToS3 (dict) --- This action writes the MIME content of the email to an S3 bucket. For example, the specified the bucket has been deleted. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM Role to use while writing to S3. This role must have access to the s3:PutObject, kms:Encrypt, and kms:GenerateDataKey APIs for the given bucket. The bucket name of the S3 bucket to write to. S3Prefix (string) --- The S3 prefix to use for the write to the s3 bucket. S3SseKmsKeyId (string) --- The KMS Key ID to use to encrypt the message in S3. Conditions (list) --- The conditions of this rule. All conditions must match the email for the actions to be executed. An empty list of conditions means that all emails match, but are still subject to any 'unless conditions' (dict) --- The conditional expression used to evaluate an email for determining if a rule action should be taken. BooleanExpression (dict) --- The condition applies to a boolean expression passed in this field. The operand on which to perform a boolean condition operation. Analysis (dict) --- The Add On ARN and its returned value to evaluate in a boolean condition expression. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Add On. The returned value from an Add On. Attribute (string) --- The boolean type representing the allowed attribute types for an email. IsInAddressList (dict) --- The structure representing the address lists and address list attribute that will be used in evaluation of boolean expression.

DmarcExpression (dict) --- The condition applies to a DMARC policy expression passed in this field. The operator to apply to the DMARC policy of the incoming email. The values to use for the given DMARC policy operator. For the operator EQUALS, if multiple values are given, they are evaluated as an OR. That is, if any of the given values match, the condition is deemed to match. For the operator NOT_EQUALS, if multiple values are given, they are evaluated as an AND. That is, only if the email's DMARC policy is not equal to any of the given values, then the condition is deemed to match. (string) --- IpExpression (dict) --- The condition applies to an IP address expression passed in this field. The IP address to evaluate in this condition. Attribute (string) --- The attribute of the email to evaluate. The operator to evaluate the IP address. The IP CIDR blocks in format 'x.y.z.w/n' (eg 10.0.0.0/8) to match with the email's IP address. For the operator CIDR_MATCHES, if multiple values are given, they are evaluated as an OR. That is, if the IP address is contained within any of the given CIDR ranges, the condition is deemed to match. For NOT_CIDR_MATCHES, if multiple CIDR ranges are given, the condition is deemed to match if the IP address is not contained in any of the given CIDR ranges. (string) --- NumberExpression (dict) --- The condition applies to a number expression passed in this field. The number to evaluate in a numeric condition expression. Attribute (string) --- An email attribute that is used as the number to evaluate. The operator for a numeric condition expression. The value to evaluate in a numeric condition expression.

That is, if any of the values match the email's string using the given operator, the condition is deemed to match. However, for NOT_EQUALS, the condition is only deemed to match if none of the given strings match the email's string. (string) --- VerdictExpression (dict) --- The condition applies to a verdict expression passed in this field. The verdict to evaluate in a verdict condition expression. Analysis (dict) --- The Add On ARN and its returned value to evaluate in a verdict condition expression. Attribute (string) --- The email verdict attribute to evaluate in a string verdict expression. The matching operator for a verdict condition expression. The values to match with the email's verdict using the given operator. For the EQUALS operator, if multiple values are given, the condition is deemed to match if any of the given verdicts match that of the email. For the NOT_EQUALS operator, if multiple values are given, the condition is deemed to match of none of the given verdicts match the verdict of the email. (string) --- Name (string) --- The user-friendly name of the rule. Unless (list) --- The 'unless conditions' of this rule. None of the conditions can match the email for the actions to be executed. If any of these conditions do match the email, then the actions are not executed. (dict) --- The conditional expression used to evaluate an email for determining if a rule action should be taken.
