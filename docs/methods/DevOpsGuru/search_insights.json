(string) --- ResourceCollection (dict) --- A collection of Amazon Web Services resources supported by DevOps Guru. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource collections supported are Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks and Amazon Web Services resources that contain the same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key. You can specify up to 500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks. CloudFormation (dict) --- An array of the names of Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks. The stacks define Amazon Web Services resources that DevOps Guru analyzes. StackNames (list) --- An array of CloudFormation stack names. (string) --- Tags (list) --- The Amazon Web Services tags that are used by resources in the resource collection. Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an Lambda function. For more information about using tags, see the Tagging best practices whitepaper. Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts. A tag key (for example, CostCenter, Environment, Project, or Secret). Tag keys are case-sensitive. An optional field known as a tag value (for example, 111122223333, Production, or a team name). Omitting the tag value is the same as using an empty string. Like tag keys, tag values are case-sensitive. Together these are known as key-value pairs. (dict) --- A collection of Amazon Web Services tags.

All Amazon Web Services resources in your account and Region tagged with this key make up your DevOps Guru application and analysis boundary. The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection. The tag's value is an optional field used to associate a string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333, Production, or a team name). The key and value are the tag's key pair. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value. (string) --- ServiceCollection (dict) --- A collection of the names of Amazon Web Services services.
