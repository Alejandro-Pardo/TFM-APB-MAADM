CloudFormation (dict) --- An object that specifies the CloudFormation stack that defines the Amazon Web Services resources used to create a monthly estimate for DevOps Guru. StackNames (list) --- An array of CloudFormation stack names. Its size is fixed at 1 item. (string) --- Tags (list) --- The Amazon Web Services tags used to filter the resource collection that is used for a cost estimate. Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an Lambda function. For more information about using tags, see the Tagging best practices whitepaper. Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts. A tag key (for example, CostCenter, Environment, Project, or Secret). Tag keys are case-sensitive. An optional field known as a tag value (for example, 111122223333, Production, or a team name). Omitting the tag value is the same as using an empty string. Like tag keys, tag values are case-sensitive. Together these are known as key-value pairs. (dict) --- Information about a collection of Amazon Web Services resources that are identified by an Amazon Web Services tag. This collection of resources is used to create a monthly cost estimate for DevOps Guru to analyze Amazon Web Services resources. The maximum number of tags you can specify for a cost estimate is one. The estimate created is for the cost to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources defined by the tag. For more information, see Stacks in the Amazon Web Services CloudFormation User Guide. An Amazon Web Services tag key that is used to identify the Amazon Web Services resources that DevOps Guru analyzes. All Amazon Web Services resources in your account and Region tagged with this key make up your DevOps Guru application and analysis boundary. The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection. The tag's value is an optional field used to associate a string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333, Production, or a team name). The key and value are the tag's key pair. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value. (string) ---",
