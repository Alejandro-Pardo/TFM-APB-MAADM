      "description": "Specifies the configuration and other settings for a message to send to all the endpoints that are associated with a list of users. Context (dict) --- A map of custom attribute-value pairs. For a push notification, Amazon Pinpoint adds these attributes to the data.pinpoint object in the body of the notification payload. Amazon Pinpoint also provides these attributes in the events that it generates for users-messages deliveries. (string) --- (string) --- The settings and content for the default message and any default messages that you defined for specific channels. ADMMessage (dict) --- The default push notification message for the ADM (Amazon Device Messaging) channel. This message overrides the default push notification message (DefaultPushNotificationMessage). Action (string) --- The action to occur if the recipient taps the push notification. Valid values are: OPEN_APP - Your app opens or it becomes the foreground app if it was sent to the background. This is the default action. DEEP_LINK - Your app opens and displays a designated user interface in the app. This action uses the deep-linking features of the Android platform. URL - The default mobile browser on the recipient's device opens and loads the web page at a URL that you specify. Body (string) --- The body of the notification message. ConsolidationKey (string) --- An arbitrary string that indicates that multiple messages are logically the same and that Amazon Device Messaging (ADM) can drop previously enqueued messages in favor of this message.

If specified, this value overrides all other content for the message. SilentPush (boolean) --- Specifies whether the notification is a silent push notification, which is a push notification that doesn't display on a recipient's device. Silent push notifications can be used for cases such as updating an app's configuration or supporting phone home functionality. SmallImageIconUrl (string) --- The URL of the small icon image to display in the status bar and the content view of the push notification. Sound (string) --- The sound to play when the recipient receives the push notification. You can use the default stream or specify the file name of a sound resource that's bundled in your app. On an Android platform, the sound file must reside in /res/raw/. Substitutions (dict) --- The default message variables to use in the notification message. You can override the default variables with individual address variables. (string) --- (list) --- (string) --- Title (string) --- The title to display above the notification message on the recipient's device.

Valid values are: alert - For a standard notification that's displayed on recipients' devices and prompts a recipient to interact with the notification. background - For a silent notification that delivers content in the background and isn't displayed on recipients' devices. complication - For a notification that contains update information for an app's complication timeline. fileprovider - For a notification that signals changes to a File Provider extension. mdm - For a notification that tells managed devices to contact the MDM server. voip - For a notification that provides information about an incoming VoIP call. Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-push-type request header when it sends the notification message to APNs. If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the value to alert or background automatically, based on the value that you specify for the SilentPush or RawContent property of the message. For more information about the apns-push-type request header, see Sending Notification Requests to APNs on the Apple Developer website. This setting uses the deep-linking features of the iOS platform. Badge (integer) --- The key that indicates whether and how to modify the badge of your app's icon when the recipient receives the push notification. If this key isn't included in the dictionary, the badge doesn't change. To remove the badge, set this value to 0. Category (string) --- The key that indicates the notification type for the push notification. This key is a value that's defined by the identifier property of one of your app's registered categories. CollapseId (string) --- An arbitrary identifier that, if assigned to multiple messages, APNs uses to coalesce the messages into a single push notification instead of delivering each message individually. This value can't exceed 64 bytes. Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-collapse-id request header when it sends the notification message to APNs.

This is the default value. A high priority notification should trigger an alert, play a sound, or badge your app's icon on the recipient's device.\n/para> Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-priority request header when it sends the notification message to APNs. The equivalent values for Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), formerly Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), are normal, for 5, and high, for 10. If you specify an FCM value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint accepts and converts the value to the corresponding APNs value. SilentPush (boolean) --- Specifies whether the notification is a silent push notification. A silent (or background) push notification isn't displayed on recipients' devices. You can use silent push notifications to make small updates to your app, or to display messages in an in-app message center. Amazon Pinpoint uses this property to determine the correct value for the apns-push-type request header when it sends the notification message to APNs. If you specify a value of true for this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the value for the apns-push-type header field to background. Sound (string) --- The key for the sound to play when the recipient receives the push notification. The value for this key is the name of a sound file in your app's main bundle or the Library/Sounds folder in your app's data container.

Substitutions (dict) --- The default message variables to use in the email message. (string) --- (list) --- (string) --- GCMMessage (dict) --- The default push notification message for the GCM channel, which is used to send notifications through the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), formerly Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), service. CollapseKey (string) --- An arbitrary string that identifies a group of messages that can be collapsed to ensure that only the last message is sent when delivery can resume. This helps avoid sending too many instances of the same messages when the recipient's device comes online again or becomes active. Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) collapse_key parameter when it sends the notification message to FCM. PreferredAuthenticationMethod (string) --- The preferred authentication method, with valid values 'KEY' or 'TOKEN'. If a value isn't provided then the DefaultAuthenticationMethod is used. Priority (string) --- para>normal --- The notification might be delayed. Delivery is optimized for battery usage on the recipient's device. Use this value unless immediate delivery is required. /listitem>\n* high --- The notification is sent immediately and might wake a sleeping device.\n/para> Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the FCM priority parameter when it sends the notification message to FCM. The equivalent values for Apple Push Notification service (APNs) are 5, for normal, and 10, for high. If you specify an APNs value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint accepts and converts the value to the corresponding FCM value. RestrictedPackageName (string) --- The package name of the application where registration tokens must match in order for the recipient to receive the message. (string) --- (list) --- (string) --- TimeToLive (integer) --- The amount of time, in seconds, that FCM should store and attempt to deliver the push notification, if the service is unable to deliver the notification the first time. If you don't specify this value, FCM defaults to the maximum value, which is 2,419,200 seconds (28 days).
