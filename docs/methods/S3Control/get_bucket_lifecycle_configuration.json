  "description": "Returns the lifecycle configuration information set on the Outposts bucket. For more information, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts and for information about lifecycle configuration, see Object Lifecycle Management in Amazon S3 User Guide. To use this action, you must have permission to perform the s3-outposts:GetLifecycleConfiguration action. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission, by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources. All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the Examples section. GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration has the following special error: The following actions are related to GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration:",
