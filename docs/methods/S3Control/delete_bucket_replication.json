  "description": "Deletes the replication configuration from the specified S3 on Outposts bucket. To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3-outposts:PutReplicationConfiguration action. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information about permissions, see Setting up IAM with S3 on Outposts and Managing access to S3 on Outposts buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide. All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the Examples section. For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide. The following operations are related to DeleteBucketReplication:",
