  "description": "Sets the tags for an S3 on Outposts bucket. For more information, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Use tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see Cost allocation and tagging. To use this action, you must have permissions to perform the s3-outposts:PutBucketTagging action. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing access permissions to your Amazon S3 resources. PutBucketTagging has the following special errors: All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the Examples section. The following actions are related to PutBucketTagging:",
