  "description": "Returns the replication configuration of an S3 on Outposts bucket. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide. This action requires permissions for the s3-outposts:GetReplicationConfiguration action. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information about permissions, see Setting up IAM with S3 on Outposts and Managing access to S3 on Outposts bucket in the Amazon S3 User Guide. All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the Examples section. If you include the Filter element in a replication configuration, you must also include the DeleteMarkerReplication, Status, and Priority elements. The response also returns those elements. For information about S3 on Outposts replication failure reasons, see Replication failure reasons in the Amazon S3 User Guide. The following operations are related to GetBucketReplication:",
