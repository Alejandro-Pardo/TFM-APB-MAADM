      "description": "The action that you want this job to perform on every object listed in the manifest. For more information about the available actions, see Operations in the Amazon S3 User Guide. LambdaInvoke (dict) --- Directs the specified job to invoke an Lambda function on every object in the manifest. FunctionArn (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Lambda function that the specified job will invoke on every object in the manifest. InvocationSchemaVersion (string) --- Specifies the schema version for the payload that Batch Operations sends when invoking an Lambda function. Version 1.0 is the default. Version 2.0 is required when you use Batch Operations to invoke Lambda functions that act on directory buckets, or if you need to specify UserArguments. For more information, see Automate object processing in Amazon S3 directory buckets with S3 Batch Operations and Lambda in the Amazon Web Services Storage Blog. UserArguments (dict) --- Key-value pairs that are passed in the payload that Batch Operations sends when invoking an Lambda function. You must specify InvocationSchemaVersion 2.0 for LambdaInvoke operations that include UserArguments. (string) --- (string) --- S3PutObjectCopy (dict) --- Directs the specified job to run a PUT Copy object call on every object in the manifest. TargetResource (string) --- Specifies the destination bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the batch copy operation. General purpose buckets - For example, to copy objects to a general purpose bucket named destinationBucket, set the TargetResource property to arn:aws:s3:::destinationBucket. Directory buckets - For example, to copy objects to a directory bucket named destinationBucket in the Availability Zone identified by the AZ ID usw2-az1, set the TargetResource property to arn:aws:s3express:region:account_id:/bucket/destination_bucket_base_name--usw2-az1--x-s3. A directory bucket as a destination bucket can be in Availability Zone or Local Zone. CannedAccessControlList (string) --- AccessControlGrants (list) --- (dict) --- Grantee (dict) --- TypeIdentifier (string) --- Identifier (string) --- DisplayName (string) --- Permission (string) --- MetadataDirective (string) --- ModifiedSinceConstraint (datetime) --- NewObjectMetadata (dict) --- If you don't provide this parameter, Amazon S3 copies all the metadata from the original objects. If you specify an empty set, the new objects will have no tags. Otherwise, Amazon S3 assigns the supplied tags to the new objects. CacheControl (string) --- ContentDisposition (string) --- ContentEncoding (string) --- ContentLanguage (string) --- UserMetadata (dict) --- (string) --- (string) --- ContentLength (integer) --- This member has been deprecated. ContentMD5 (string) --- This member has been deprecated. ContentType (string) --- HttpExpiresDate (datetime) --- RequesterCharged (boolean) --- This member has been deprecated. SSEAlgorithm (string) --- The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing objects in Amazon S3. Directory buckets - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) ( AES256) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) ( KMS). For more information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For the Copy operation in Batch Operations, see S3CopyObjectOperation. NewObjectTagging (list) --- Specifies a list of tags to add to the destination objects after they are copied. If NewObjectTagging is not specified, the tags of the source objects are copied to destination objects by default. (dict) --- A container for a key-value name pair. Key of the tag Value of the tag RedirectLocation (string) --- If the destination bucket is configured as a website, specifies an optional metadata property for website redirects, x-amz-website-redirect-location. Allows webpage redirects if the object copy is accessed through a website endpoint. RequesterPays (boolean) --- StorageClass (string) --- Specify the storage class for the destination objects in a Copy operation. UnModifiedSinceConstraint (datetime) --- SSEAwsKmsKeyId (string) --- Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption. If the KMS key doesn't exist in the same account that's issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key ID. TargetKeyPrefix (string) --- Specifies the folder prefix that you want the objects to be copied into. For example, to copy objects into a folder named Folder1 in the destination bucket, set the TargetKeyPrefix property to Folder1. ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus (string) --- The legal hold status to be applied to all objects in the Batch Operations job. ObjectLockMode (string) --- The retention mode to be applied to all objects in the Batch Operations job. ObjectLockRetainUntilDate (datetime) --- The date when the applied object retention configuration expires on all objects in the Batch Operations job. BucketKeyEnabled (boolean) --- Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with server-side encryption using Amazon Web Services KMS (SSE-KMS). Setting this header to true causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS. Specifying this header with an Copy action doesn't affect bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key. ChecksumAlgorithm (string) --- Indicates the algorithm that you want Amazon S3 to use to create the checksum. For more information, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide. S3PutObjectAcl (dict) --- Directs the specified job to run a PutObjectAcl call on every object in the manifest. AccessControlPolicy (dict) --- AccessControlList (dict) --- ID (string) --- DisplayName (string) --- Grants (list) --- (dict) --- Grantee (dict) --- TypeIdentifier (string) --- Identifier (string) --- DisplayName (string) --- Permission (string) --- CannedAccessControlList (string) --- S3PutObjectTagging (dict) --- Directs the specified job to run a PUT Object tagging call on every object in the manifest. TagSet (list) --- (dict) --- A container for a key-value name pair. Key of the tag Value of the tag S3DeleteObjectTagging (dict) --- Directs the specified job to execute a DELETE Object tagging call on every object in the manifest. S3InitiateRestoreObject (dict) --- Directs the specified job to initiate restore requests for every archived object in the manifest. ExpirationInDays (integer) --- This argument specifies how long the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive object remains available in Amazon S3. S3 Initiate Restore Object jobs that target S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive objects require ExpirationInDays set to 1 or greater. Conversely, do not set ExpirationInDays when creating S3 Initiate Restore Object jobs that target S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access and Deep Archive Access tier objects. Objects in S3 Intelligent-Tiering archive access tiers are not subject to restore expiry, so specifying ExpirationInDays results in restore request failure. S3 Batch Operations jobs can operate either on S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class objects or on S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access and Deep Archive Access storage tier objects, but not both types in the same job. If you need to restore objects of both types you must create separate Batch Operations jobs. GlacierJobTier (string) --- S3 Batch Operations supports STANDARD and BULK retrieval tiers, but not the EXPEDITED retrieval tier. S3PutObjectLegalHold (dict) --- Contains the configuration for an S3 Object Lock legal hold operation that an S3 Batch Operations job passes to every object to the underlying PutObjectLegalHold API operation. For more information, see Using S3 Object Lock legal hold with S3 Batch Operations in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Contains the Object Lock legal hold status to be applied to all objects in the Batch Operations job. The Object Lock legal hold status to be applied to all objects in the Batch Operations job. S3PutObjectRetention (dict) --- Contains the configuration parameters for the Object Lock retention action for an S3 Batch Operations job. Batch Operations passes every object to the underlying PutObjectRetention API operation. For more information, see Using S3 Object Lock retention with S3 Batch Operations in the Amazon S3 User Guide. BypassGovernanceRetention (boolean) --- Indicates if the action should be applied to objects in the Batch Operations job even if they have Object Lock GOVERNANCE type in place. Contains the Object Lock retention mode to be applied to all objects in the Batch Operations job. RetainUntilDate (datetime) --- The date when the applied Object Lock retention will expire on all objects set by the Batch Operations job. Mode (string) --- The Object Lock retention mode to be applied to all objects in the Batch Operations job. S3ReplicateObject (dict) --- Directs the specified job to invoke ReplicateObject on every object in the job's manifest.",
