Before you can create a grant, you must have an S3 Access Grants instance in the same Region as the S3 data. You can create an S3 Access Grants instance using the CreateAccessGrantsInstance. You must also have registered at least one S3 data location in your S3 Access Grants instance using CreateAccessGrantsLocation. You must have the s3:CreateAccessGrant permission to use this operation. For any directory identity - sso:DescribeInstance and sso:DescribeApplication. For directory users - identitystore:DescribeUser. For directory groups - identitystore:DescribeGroup.",
