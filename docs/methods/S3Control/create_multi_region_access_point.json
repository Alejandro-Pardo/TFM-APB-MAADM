  "description": "Creates a Multi-Region Access Point and associates it with the specified buckets. For more information about creating Multi-Region Access Points, see Creating Multi-Region Access Points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. This action will always be routed to the US West (Oregon) Region. For more information about the restrictions around working with Multi-Region Access Points, see Multi-Region Access Point restrictions and limitations in the Amazon S3 User Guide. This request is asynchronous, meaning that you might receive a response before the command has completed. When this request provides a response, it provides a token that you can use to monitor the status of the request with DescribeMultiRegionAccessPointOperation.

PublicAccessBlock (dict) --- The PublicAccessBlock configuration that you want to apply to this Amazon S3 account. You can enable the configuration options in any combination. For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or object public, see The Meaning of 'Public' in the Amazon S3 User Guide. This data type is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts. BlockPublicAcls (boolean) --- Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access control lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes the following behavior: PutBucketAcl and PutObjectAcl calls fail if the specified ACL is public. PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL. PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL. Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs. This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts. IgnorePublicAcls (boolean) --- Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and any objects that they contain. Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set. BlockPublicPolicy (boolean) --- Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket policy allows public access. Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies. RestrictPublicBuckets (boolean) --- Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket policies for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE restricts access to buckets with public policies to only Amazon Web Services service principals and authorized users within this account. Enabling this setting doesn't affect previously stored bucket policies, except that public and cross-account access within any public bucket policy, including non-public delegation to specific accounts, is blocked. The buckets in different Regions that are associated with the Multi-Region Access Point. (dict) --- A Region that supports a Multi-Region Access Point as well as the associated bucket for the Region. The name of the associated bucket for the Region.
