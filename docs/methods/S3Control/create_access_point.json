  "description": "Creates an access point and associates it to a specified bucket. For more information, see Managing access to shared datasets with access points or Managing access to shared datasets in directory buckets with access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. To create an access point and attach it to a volume on an Amazon FSx file system, see CreateAndAttachS3AccessPoint in the Amazon FSx API Reference. All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the Examples section. The following actions are related to CreateAccessPoint:",
