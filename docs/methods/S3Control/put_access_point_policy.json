  "description": "Associates an access policy with the specified access point. Each access point can have only one policy, so a request made to this API replaces any existing policy associated with the specified access point. All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the Examples section. The following actions are related to PutAccessPointPolicy:",

For example, to access the access point reports-ap through Outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/accesspoint/reports-ap.
