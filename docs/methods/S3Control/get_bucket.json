  "description": "Gets an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. For more information, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the Outposts bucket, the calling identity must have the s3-outposts:GetBucket permissions on the specified Outposts bucket and belong to the Outposts bucket owner's account in order to use this action. Only users from Outposts bucket owner account with the right permissions can perform actions on an Outposts bucket. If you don't have s3-outposts:GetBucket permissions or you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a 403 Access Denied error. The following actions are related to GetBucket for Amazon S3 on Outposts: All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.",
