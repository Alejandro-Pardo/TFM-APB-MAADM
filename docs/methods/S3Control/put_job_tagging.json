You can associate S3 Batch Operations tags with any job by sending a PUT request against the tagging subresource that is associated with the job. To modify the existing tag set, you can either replace the existing tag set entirely, or make changes within the existing tag set by retrieving the existing tag set using GetJobTagging, modify that tag set, and use this operation to replace the tag set with the one you modified. For more information, see Controlling access and labeling jobs using tags in the Amazon S3 User Guide. To use the PutJobTagging operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:PutJobTagging action. Related actions include:",
