  "description": "Encrypts plaintext data to ciphertext using a symmetric (TDES, AES), asymmetric (RSA), or derived (DUKPT or EMV) encryption key scheme. For more information, see Encrypt data in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. You can generate an encryption key within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling CreateKey. You can import your own encryption key by calling ImportKey. For this operation, the key must have KeyModesOfUse set to Encrypt. In asymmetric encryption, plaintext is encrypted using public component. You can import the public component of an asymmetric key pair created outside Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling ImportKey. This operation also supports dynamic keys, allowing you to pass a dynamic encryption key as a TR-31 WrappedKeyBlock. This can be used when key material is frequently rotated, such as during every card transaction, and there is need to avoid importing short-lived keys into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. To encrypt using dynamic keys, the keyARN is the Key Encryption Key (KEK) of the TR-31 wrapped encryption key material. The incoming wrapped key shall have a key purpose of D0 with a mode of use of B or D. For more information, see Using Dynamic Keys in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. For symmetric and DUKPT encryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports TDES and AES algorithms. For EMV encryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports TDES algorithms.For asymmetric encryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports RSA. When you use TDES or TDES DUKPT, the plaintext data length must be a multiple of 8 bytes. For AES or AES DUKPT, the plaintext data length must be a multiple of 16 bytes. For RSA, it sould be equal to the key size unless padding is enabled. To encrypt using DUKPT, you must already have a BDK (Base Derivation Key) key in your account with KeyModesOfUse set to DeriveKey, or you can generate a new DUKPT key by calling CreateKey. To encrypt using EMV, you must already have an IMK (Issuer Master Key) key in your account with KeyModesOfUse set to DeriveKey. For information about valid keys for this operation, see Understanding key attributes and Key types for specific data operations in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. Cross-account use: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.",
