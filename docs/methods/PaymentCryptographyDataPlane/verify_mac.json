In this operation, you must use the same message data, secret encryption key and MAC algorithm that was used to generate MAC. You can use this operation to verify a DUPKT, CMAC, HMAC or EMV MAC by setting generation attributes and algorithm to the associated values. For information about valid keys for this operation, see Understanding key attributes and Key types for specific data operations in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.

Algorithm (string) --- The encryption algorithm for MAC generation or verification. EmvMac (dict) --- Parameters that are required for MAC generation or verification using EMV MAC algorithm. The method to use when deriving the master key for EMV MAC generation or verification. The Primary Account Number (PAN), a unique identifier for a payment credit or debit card and associates the card to a specific account holder. A number that identifies and differentiates payment cards with the same Primary Account Number (PAN). The method of deriving a session key for EMV MAC generation or verification. Parameters that are required to generate session key for EMV generation and verification. ApplicationCryptogram (string) --- The cryptogram provided by the terminal during transaction processing. ApplicationTransactionCounter (string) --- The transaction counter that is provided by the terminal during transaction processing. DukptIso9797Algorithm1 (dict) --- Parameters that are required for MAC generation or verification using DUKPT ISO 9797 algorithm1. The unique identifier known as Key Serial Number (KSN) that comes from an encrypting device using DUKPT encryption method. The KSN is derived from the encrypting device unique identifier and an internal transaction counter. The type of use of DUKPT, which can be MAC generation, MAC verification, or both. DukptDerivationType (string) --- The key type derived using DUKPT from a Base Derivation Key (BDK) and Key Serial Number (KSN). This must be less than or equal to the strength of the BDK. For example, you can't use AES_128 as a derivation type for a BDK of AES_128 or TDES_2KEY.
