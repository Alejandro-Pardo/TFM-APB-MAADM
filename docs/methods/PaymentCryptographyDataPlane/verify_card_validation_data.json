For more information, see Verify card data in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. This operation validates the CVV or CSC codes that is printed on a payment credit or debit card during card payment transaction. The input values are typically provided as part of an inbound transaction to an issuer or supporting platform partner. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses CVV or CSC, PAN (Primary Account Number) and expiration date of the card to check its validity during transaction processing. In this operation, the CVK (Card Verification Key) encryption key for use with card data verification is same as the one in used for  GenerateCardValidationData. For information about valid keys for this operation, see Understanding key attributes and Key types for specific data operations in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. Cross-account use: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.",
