  "description": "Re-encrypt ciphertext using DUKPT or Symmetric data encryption keys. You can either generate an encryption key within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling CreateKey or import your own encryption key by calling ImportKey. The KeyArn for use with this operation must be in a compatible key state with KeyModesOfUse set to Encrypt. This operation also supports dynamic keys, allowing you to pass a dynamic encryption key as a TR-31 WrappedKeyBlock. This can be used when key material is frequently rotated, such as during every card transaction, and there is need to avoid importing short-lived keys into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. To re-encrypt using dynamic keys, the keyARN is the Key Encryption Key (KEK) of the TR-31 wrapped encryption key material. The incoming wrapped key shall have a key purpose of D0 with a mode of use of B or D. For more information, see Using Dynamic Keys in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. For symmetric and DUKPT encryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports TDES and AES algorithms. To encrypt using DUKPT, a DUKPT key must already exist within your account with KeyModesOfUse set to DeriveKey or a new DUKPT can be generated by calling CreateKey. For information about valid keys for this operation, see Understanding key attributes and Key types for specific data operations in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. Cross-account use: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.",
