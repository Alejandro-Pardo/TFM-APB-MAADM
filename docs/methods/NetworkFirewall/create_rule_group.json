      "description": "An object that defines the rule group rules. RuleVariables (dict) --- Settings that are available for use in the rules in the rule group. You can only use these for stateful rule groups. IPSets (dict) --- A list of IP addresses and address ranges, in CIDR notation. (string) --- (dict) --- A list of IP addresses and address ranges, in CIDR notation. This is part of a  RuleVariables. The list of IP addresses and address ranges, in CIDR notation. (string) --- PortSets (dict) --- A list of port ranges. (string) --- (dict) --- A set of port ranges for use in the rules in a rule group. Definition (list) --- The set of port ranges. (string) --- ReferenceSets (dict) --- The list of a rule group's reference sets. IPSetReferences (dict) --- The list of IP set references. (string) --- (dict) --- Configures one or more IP set references for a Suricata-compatible rule group. This is used in  CreateRuleGroup or  UpdateRuleGroup. An IP set reference is a rule variable that references resources that you create and manage in another Amazon Web Services service, such as an Amazon VPC prefix list. Network Firewall IP set references enable you to dynamically update the contents of your rules. When you create, update, or delete the resource you are referencing in your rule, Network Firewall automatically updates the rule's content with the changes. For more information about IP set references in Network Firewall, see Using IP set references in the Network Firewall Developer Guide. Network Firewall currently supports Amazon VPC prefix lists and resource groups in IP set references. ReferenceArn (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that you are referencing in your rule group. The stateful rules or stateless rules for the rule group. RulesString (string) --- Stateful inspection criteria, provided in Suricata compatible rules. Suricata is an open-source threat detection framework that includes a standard rule-based language for network traffic inspection. These rules contain the inspection criteria and the action to take for traffic that matches the criteria, so this type of rule group doesn't have a separate action setting. RulesSourceList (dict) --- Stateful inspection criteria for a domain list rule group. The domains that you want to inspect for in your traffic flows. Valid domain specifications are the following: Explicit names. For example, abc.example.com matches only the domain abc.example.com. Names that use a domain wildcard, which you indicate with an initial --\u0098 .'. For example, .example.com matches example.com and matches all subdomains of example.com, such as abc.example.com and www.example.com. (string) --- The protocols you want to inspect. Specify TLS_SNI for HTTPS. Specify HTTP_HOST for HTTP. You can specify either or both. (string) --- Whether you want to allow or deny access to the domains in your target list. StatefulRules (list) --- An array of individual stateful rules inspection criteria to be used together in a stateful rule group. Use this option to specify simple Suricata rules with protocol, source and destination, ports, direction, and rule options. For information about the Suricata Rules format, see Rules Format. (dict) --- A single Suricata rules specification, for use in a stateful rule group. Use this option to specify a simple Suricata rule with protocol, source and destination, ports, direction, and rule options. Defines what Network Firewall should do with the packets in a traffic flow when the flow matches the stateful rule criteria. For all actions, Network Firewall performs the specified action and discontinues stateful inspection of the traffic flow. The actions for a stateful rule are defined as follows: PASS - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination. DROP - Blocks the packets from going to the intended destination and sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in the  Firewall  LoggingConfiguration. ALERT - Sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in the  Firewall  LoggingConfiguration. You can use this action to test a rule that you intend to use to drop traffic. You can enable the rule with ALERT action, verify in the logs that the rule is filtering as you want, then change the action to DROP. REJECT - Drops traffic that matches the conditions of the stateful rule, and sends a TCP reset packet back to sender of the packet. A TCP reset packet is a packet with no payload and an RST bit contained in the TCP header flags. REJECT is available only for TCP traffic. This option doesn't support FTP or IMAP protocols. The stateful inspection criteria for this rule, used to inspect traffic flows. The protocol to inspect for. To specify all, you can use IP, because all traffic on Amazon Web Services and on the internet is IP. The source IP address or address range to inspect for, in CIDR notation. To match with any address, specify ANY. Specify an IP address or a block of IP addresses in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. Network Firewall supports all address ranges for IPv4 and IPv6. Examples: To configure Network Firewall to inspect for the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify 192.0.2.44/32. To configure Network Firewall to inspect for IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify 192.0.2.0/24. To configure Network Firewall to inspect for the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128. To configure Network Firewall to inspect for IP addresses from 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to 1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, specify 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64. For more information about CIDR notation, see the Wikipedia entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing. The source port to inspect for. You can specify an individual port, for example 1994 and you can specify a port range, for example 1990:1994. To match with any port, specify ANY. The direction of traffic flow to inspect. If set to ANY, the inspection matches bidirectional traffic, both from the source to the destination and from the destination to the source. If set to FORWARD, the inspection only matches traffic going from the source to the destination. The destination IP address or address range to inspect for, in CIDR notation. The destination port to inspect for. Additional options for the rule. These are the Suricata RuleOptions settings. (dict) --- Additional settings for a stateful rule. This is part of the  StatefulRule configuration. The keyword for the Suricata compatible rule option. You must include a sid (signature ID), and can optionally include other keywords. For information about Suricata compatible keywords, see Rule options in the Suricata documentation. Settings (list) --- The settings of the Suricata compatible rule option. Rule options have zero or more setting values, and the number of possible and required settings depends on the Keyword. For more information about the settings for specific options, see Rule options. (string) --- StatelessRulesAndCustomActions (dict) --- Stateless inspection criteria to be used in a stateless rule group. Defines the set of stateless rules for use in a stateless rule group. (dict) --- A single stateless rule. This is used in  StatelessRulesAndCustomActions. Defines the stateless 5-tuple packet inspection criteria and the action to take on a packet that matches the criteria. Criteria for Network Firewall to use to inspect an individual packet in stateless rule inspection. Each match attributes set can include one or more items such as IP address, CIDR range, port number, protocol, and TCP flags. Sources (list) --- The source IP addresses and address ranges to inspect for, in CIDR notation. If not specified, this matches with any source address. (dict) --- A single IP address specification. This is used in the  MatchAttributes source and destination specifications. Destinations (list) --- The destination IP addresses and address ranges to inspect for, in CIDR notation. If not specified, this matches with any destination address. SourcePorts (list) --- The source port to inspect for. If not specified, this matches with any source port. This setting is only used for protocols 6 (TCP) and 17 (UDP). (dict) --- A single port range specification. This is used for source and destination port ranges in the stateless rule  MatchAttributes, SourcePorts, and DestinationPorts settings. The lower limit of the port range. This must be less than or equal to the ToPort specification. The upper limit of the port range. This must be greater than or equal to the FromPort specification. DestinationPorts (list) --- The destination port to inspect for. Protocols (list) --- The protocols to inspect for, specified using the assigned internet protocol number (IANA) for each protocol. If not specified, this matches with any protocol. (integer) --- TCPFlags (list) --- The TCP flags and masks to inspect for. If not specified, this matches with any settings. This setting is only used for protocol 6 (TCP). (dict) --- TCP flags and masks to inspect packets for, used in stateless rules  MatchAttributes settings. Used in conjunction with the Masks setting to define the flags that must be set and flags that must not be set in order for the packet to match. This setting can only specify values that are also specified in the Masks setting. For the flags that are specified in the masks setting, the following must be true for the packet to match: The ones that are set in this flags setting must be set in the packet. The ones that are not set in this flags setting must also not be set in the packet. (string) --- Masks (list) --- The set of flags to consider in the inspection. To inspect all flags in the valid values list, leave this with no setting. (string) --- The actions to take on a packet that matches one of the stateless rule definition's match attributes. You must specify a standard action and you can add custom actions. For every rule, you must specify exactly one of the following standard actions. aws:pass - Discontinues all inspection of the packet and permits it to go to its intended destination. aws:drop - Discontinues all inspection of the packet and blocks it from going to its intended destination. aws:forward_to_sfe - Discontinues stateless inspection of the packet and forwards it to the stateful rule engine for inspection. Additionally, you can specify a custom action. To do this, you define a custom action by name and type, then provide the name you've assigned to the action in this Actions setting. For information about the options, see  CustomAction. To provide more than one action in this setting, separate the settings with a comma. For example, if you have a custom PublishMetrics action that you've named MyMetricsAction, then you could specify the standard action aws:pass and the custom action with ['aws:pass', 'MyMetricsAction']. (string) --- Indicates the order in which to run this rule relative to all of the rules that are defined for a stateless rule group. Network Firewall evaluates the rules in a rule group starting with the lowest priority setting. You must ensure that the priority settings are unique for the rule group. Each stateless rule group uses exactly one StatelessRulesAndCustomActions object, and each StatelessRulesAndCustomActions contains exactly one StatelessRules object. To ensure unique priority settings for your rule groups, set unique priorities for the stateless rules that you define inside any single StatelessRules object. You can change the priority settings of your rules at any time. To make it easier to insert rules later, number them so there's a wide range in between, for example use 100, 200, and so on. CustomActions (list) --- Defines an array of individual custom action definitions that are available for use by the stateless rules in this StatelessRulesAndCustomActions specification. You name each custom action that you define, and then you can use it by name in your  StatelessRule  RuleDefinition Actions specification. (dict) --- An optional, non-standard action to use for stateless packet handling. You can define this in addition to the standard action that you must specify. You define and name the custom actions that you want to be able to use, and then you reference them by name in your actions settings. You can use custom actions in the following places: In a rule group's  StatelessRulesAndCustomActions specification. The custom actions are available for use by name inside the StatelessRulesAndCustomActions where you define them. You can use them for your stateless rule actions to specify what to do with a packet that matches the rule's match attributes. In a  FirewallPolicy specification, in StatelessCustomActions. The custom actions are available for use inside the policy where you define them. You can use them for the policy's default stateless actions settings to specify what to do with packets that don't match any of the policy's stateless rules. The descriptive name of the custom action. You can't change the name of a custom action after you create it. The custom action associated with the action name. PublishMetricAction (dict) --- Stateless inspection criteria that publishes the specified metrics to Amazon CloudWatch for the matching packet. This setting defines a CloudWatch dimension value to be published. You can pair this custom action with any of the standard stateless rule actions. For example, you could pair this in a rule action with the standard action that forwards the packet for stateful inspection. Then, when a packet matches the rule, Network Firewall publishes metrics for the packet and forwards it. (dict) --- The value to use in an Amazon CloudWatch custom metric dimension. This is used in the PublishMetrics  CustomAction. A CloudWatch custom metric dimension is a name/value pair that's part of the identity of a metric. Network Firewall sets the dimension name to CustomAction and you provide the dimension value. For more information about CloudWatch custom metric dimensions, see Publishing Custom Metrics in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. The value to use in the custom metric dimension. StatefulRuleOptions (dict) --- Additional options governing how Network Firewall handles stateful rules. The policies where you use your stateful rule group must have stateful rule options settings that are compatible with these settings. Some limitations apply; for more information, see Strict evaluation order in the Network Firewall Developer Guide. RuleOrder (string) --- Indicates how to manage the order of the rule evaluation for the rule group. DEFAULT_ACTION_ORDER is the default behavior. Stateful rules are provided to the rule engine as Suricata compatible strings, and Suricata evaluates them based on certain settings. For more information, see Evaluation order for stateful rules in the Network Firewall Developer Guide.",
