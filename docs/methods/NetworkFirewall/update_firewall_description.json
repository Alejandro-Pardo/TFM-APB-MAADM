The token marks the state of the firewall resource at the time of the request. To make an unconditional change to the firewall, omit the token in your update request. Without the token, Network Firewall performs your updates regardless of whether the firewall has changed since you last retrieved it. To make a conditional change to the firewall, provide the token in your update request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the firewall hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an InvalidTokenException. If this happens, retrieve the firewall again to get a current copy of it with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token.",
