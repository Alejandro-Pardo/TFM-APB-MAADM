(dict) --- Information about the build input source code for the build project. The type of repository that contains the source code to be built. Valid values include: BITBUCKET: The source code is in a Bitbucket repository. CODECOMMIT: The source code is in an CodeCommit repository. CODEPIPELINE: The source code settings are specified in the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline. GITHUB: The source code is in a GitHub repository. GITHUB_ENTERPRISE: The source code is in a GitHub Enterprise Server repository. GITLAB: The source code is in a GitLab repository. GITLAB_SELF_MANAGED: The source code is in a self-managed GitLab repository. NO_SOURCE: The project does not have input source code. S3: The source code is in an Amazon S3 bucket. location (string) --- Information about the location of the source code to be built. Valid values include: For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline, location should not be specified. If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores it. This is because CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value. For source code in an CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the buildspec file (for example, https://git-codecommit.<region-ID>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<repo-name>). For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the following. The path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, <bucket-name>/<path>/<object-name>.zip). The path to the folder that contains the source code (for example, <bucket-name>/<path-to-source-code>/<folder>/). For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon Web Services account to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub Authorize application page, for Organization access, choose Request access next to each repository you want to allow CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose Authorize application. (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to use this connection, in the source object, set the auth object's type value to OAUTH. For source code in an GitLab or self-managed GitLab repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon Web Services account to your GitLab account. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitLab, on the Connections Authorize application page, choose Authorize. Then on the CodeConnections Create GitLab connection page, choose Connect to GitLab. (After you have connected to your GitLab account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to override the default connection and use this connection instead, set the auth object's type value to CODECONNECTIONS in the source object. For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon Web Services account to your Bitbucket account. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket Confirm access to your account page, choose Grant access. (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. If you specify CODEPIPELINE for the Type property, don't specify this property. For all of the other types, you must specify Location. gitCloneDepth (integer) --- Information about the Git clone depth for the build project. gitSubmodulesConfig (dict) --- Information about the Git submodules configuration for the build project. Set to true to fetch Git submodules for your CodeBuild build project. buildspec (string) --- The buildspec file declaration to use for the builds in this build project. If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see Buildspec File Name and Storage Location. auth (dict) --- Information about the authorization settings for CodeBuild to access the source code to be built. The authorization type to use. Valid options are OAUTH, CODECONNECTIONS, or SECRETS_MANAGER. resource (string) --- The resource value that applies to the specified authorization type. reportBuildStatus (boolean) --- Set to true to report the status of a build's start and finish to your source provider. This option is valid only when your source provider is GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Self Managed, GitLab, GitLab Self Managed, or Bitbucket. If this is set and you use a different source provider, an invalidInputException is thrown. To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see Source provider access in the CodeBuild User Guide. The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider. If your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you must push a new commit to the repo for a change to this property to take effect. buildStatusConfig (dict) --- Contains information that defines how the build project reports the build status to the source provider. This option is only used when the source provider is GITHUB, GITHUB_ENTERPRISE, or BITBUCKET. context (string) --- Specifies the context of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. The usage of this parameter depends on the source provider. Bitbucket This parameter is used for the name parameter in the Bitbucket commit status. For more information, see build in the Bitbucket API documentation. GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server This parameter is used for the context parameter in the GitHub commit status. For more information, see Create a commit status in the GitHub developer guide. targetUrl (string) --- Specifies the target url of the build status CodeBuild sends to the source provider. Bitbucket This parameter is used for the url parameter in the Bitbucket commit status. GitHub/GitHub Enterprise Server This parameter is used for the target_url parameter in the GitHub commit status. insecureSsl (boolean) --- Enable this flag to ignore SSL warnings while connecting to the project source code. sourceIdentifier (string) --- An identifier for this project source. The identifier can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores, and must be less than 128 characters in length.",
