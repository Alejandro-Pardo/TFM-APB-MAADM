  "description": "If the DNS server for your self-managed domain uses a publicly addressable IP address, you must add a CIDR address block to correctly route traffic to and from your Microsoft AD on Amazon Web Services. AddIpRoutes adds this address block. You can also use AddIpRoutes to facilitate routing traffic that uses public IP ranges from your Microsoft AD on Amazon Web Services to a peer VPC. Before you call AddIpRoutes, ensure that all of the required permissions have been explicitly granted through a policy. For details about what permissions are required to run the AddIpRoutes operation, see Directory Service API Permissions: Actions, Resources, and Conditions Reference.",
