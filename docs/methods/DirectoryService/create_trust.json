  "description": "Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory allows you to configure trust relationships. For example, you can establish a trust between your Managed Microsoft AD directory, and your existing self-managed Microsoft Active Directory. This would allow you to provide users and groups access to resources in either domain, with a single set of credentials. This action initiates the creation of the Amazon Web Services side of a trust relationship between an Managed Microsoft AD directory and an external domain. You can create either a forest trust or an external trust.",
