      "description": "The updated property definitions of the asset model. For more information, see Asset properties in the IoT SiteWise User Guide. You can specify up to 200 properties per asset model. For more information, see Quotas in the IoT SiteWise User Guide. (dict) --- Contains information about an asset model property. id (string) --- The ID of the asset model property. If you are callling UpdateAssetModel to create a new property: You can specify its ID here, if desired. IoT SiteWise automatically generates a unique ID for you, so this parameter is never required. However, if you prefer to supply your own ID instead, you can specify it here in UUID format. If you specify your own ID, it must be globally unique. If you are calling UpdateAssetModel to modify an existing property: This can be either the actual ID in UUID format, or else externalId: followed by the external ID, if it has one. For more information, see Referencing objects with external IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide. externalId (string) --- The external ID (if any) provided in the CreateAssetModel or UpdateAssetModel operation. You can assign an external ID by specifying this value as part of a call to UpdateAssetModel. However, you can't change the external ID if one is already assigned. For more information, see Using external IDs in the IoT SiteWise User Guide. The name of the asset model property. The data type of the asset model property. If you specify STRUCT, you must also specify dataTypeSpec to identify the type of the structure for this property. dataTypeSpec (string) --- The data type of the structure for this property. This parameter exists on properties that have the STRUCT data type. unit (string) --- The unit of the asset model property, such as Newtons or RPM. The property type (see PropertyType). attribute (dict) --- Specifies an asset attribute property. An attribute generally contains static information, such as the serial number of an IIoT wind turbine. defaultValue (string) --- The default value of the asset model property attribute. All assets that you create from the asset model contain this attribute value. You can update an attribute's value after you create an asset. For more information, see Updating attribute values in the IoT SiteWise User Guide. measurement (dict) --- Specifies an asset measurement property. A measurement represents a device's raw sensor data stream, such as timestamped temperature values or timestamped power values. processingConfig (dict) --- The processing configuration for the given measurement property. You can configure measurements to be kept at the edge or forwarded to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. By default, measurements are forwarded to the cloud. The forwarding configuration for the given measurement property. The forwarding state for the given property. transform (dict) --- Specifies an asset transform property. A transform contains a mathematical expression that maps a property's data points from one form to another, such as a unit conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The mathematical expression that defines the transformation function. You can specify up to 10 variables per expression. You can specify up to 10 functions per expression. The list of variables used in the expression. (dict) --- Contains expression variable information. The friendly name of the variable to be used in the expression. The variable that identifies an asset property from which to use values. propertyId (string) --- The ID of the property to use as the variable. You can use the property name if it's from the same asset model. If the property has an external ID, you can specify externalId: followed by the external ID. hierarchyId (string) --- The ID of the hierarchy to query for the property ID. You can use the hierarchy's name instead of the hierarchy's ID. If the hierarchy has an external ID, you can specify externalId: followed by the external ID. You use a hierarchy ID instead of a model ID because you can have several hierarchies using the same model and therefore the same propertyId. For example, you might have separately grouped assets that come from the same asset model. For more information, see Asset hierarchies in the IoT SiteWise User Guide. propertyPath (list) --- The path of the property. (dict) --- Represents one level between a property and the root of the asset model. id (string) --- The ID of the path segment. name (string) --- The name of the path segment. processingConfig (dict) --- The processing configuration for the given transform property. You can configure transforms to be kept at the edge or forwarded to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. You can also configure transforms to be computed at the edge or in the cloud. The compute location for the given transform property. forwardingConfig (dict) --- The forwarding configuration for a given property. metric (dict) --- Specifies an asset metric property. A metric contains a mathematical expression that uses aggregate functions to process all input data points over a time interval and output a single data point, such as to calculate the average hourly temperature. The mathematical expression that defines the metric aggregation function. The window (time interval) over which IoT SiteWise computes the metric's aggregation expression. IoT SiteWise computes one data point per window. tumbling (dict) --- The tumbling time interval window. The time interval for the tumbling window. The interval time must be between 1 minute and 1 week. IoT SiteWise computes the 1w interval the end of Sunday at midnight each week (UTC), the 1d interval at the end of each day at midnight (UTC), the 1h interval at the end of each hour, and so on. When IoT SiteWise aggregates data points for metric computations, the start of each interval is exclusive and the end of each interval is inclusive. IoT SiteWise places the computed data point at the end of the interval. offset (string) --- The offset for the tumbling window. The offset parameter accepts the following: The offset time. For example, if you specify 18h for offset and 1d for interval, IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways: If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric. If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day. The ISO 8601 format. For example, if you specify PT18H for offset and 1d for interval, IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways: If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric. The 24-hour clock. For example, if you specify 00:03:00 for offset, 5m for interval, and you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 2:03 PM (UTC). You get the second aggregation result at 2:08 PM (UTC). The offset time zone. For example, if you specify 2021-07-23T18:00-08 for offset and 1d for interval, IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways: If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (PST), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) on the day when you create the metric. If you create the metric after 6 PM (PST), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) the next day. processingConfig (dict) --- The processing configuration for the given metric property. You can configure metrics to be computed at the edge or in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. By default, metrics are forwarded to the cloud. The compute location for the given metric property. path (list) --- The structured path to the property from the root of the asset model. name (string) --- The name of the path segment.",

The compute location for the given transform property. forwardingConfig (dict) --- The forwarding configuration for a given property. metric (dict) --- Specifies an asset metric property. A metric contains a mathematical expression that uses aggregate functions to process all input data points over a time interval and output a single data point, such as to calculate the average hourly temperature. The mathematical expression that defines the metric aggregation function. The window (time interval) over which IoT SiteWise computes the metric's aggregation expression. IoT SiteWise computes one data point per window. tumbling (dict) --- The tumbling time interval window. The time interval for the tumbling window.

IoT SiteWise places the computed data point at the end of the interval. offset (string) --- The offset for the tumbling window. The offset parameter accepts the following: The offset time. For example, if you specify 18h for offset and 1d for interval, IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways: If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric. If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day. The ISO 8601 format. For example, if you specify PT18H for offset and 1d for interval, IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways: If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric. The 24-hour clock. For example, if you specify 00:03:00 for offset, 5m for interval, and you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at 2:03 PM (UTC). You get the second aggregation result at 2:08 PM (UTC). The offset time zone. For example, if you specify 2021-07-23T18:00-08 for offset and 1d for interval, IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways: If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (PST), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) on the day when you create the metric. If you create the metric after 6 PM (PST), you get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) the next day. processingConfig (dict) --- The processing configuration for the given metric property.
