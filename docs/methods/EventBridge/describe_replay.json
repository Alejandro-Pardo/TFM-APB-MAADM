  "description": "Retrieves details about a replay. Use DescribeReplay to determine the progress of a running replay. A replay processes events to replay based on the time in the event, and replays them using 1 minute intervals. If you use StartReplay and specify an EventStartTime and an EventEndTime that covers a 20 minute time range, the events are replayed from the first minute of that 20 minute range first. Then the events from the second minute are replayed. You can use DescribeReplay to determine the progress of a replay. The value returned for EventLastReplayedTime indicates the time within the specified time range associated with the last event replayed.",
