  "description": "Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets if they are already associated with the rule. Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered. The maximum number of entries per request is 10. For a list of services you can configure as targets for events, see EventBridge targets in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide . Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the Amazon Web Services Management Console. The built-in targets are: For some target types, PutTargets provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the KinesisParameters argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the RunCommandParameters field. To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge needs the appropriate permissions: For more information, see Authentication and Access Control in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide . If another Amazon Web Services account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using PutPermission), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the Arn value when you run PutTargets. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more information, see Amazon EventBridge Pricing. If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions in the Target structure. For more information, see Sending and Receiving Events Between Amazon Web Services Accounts in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide. For more information about enabling cross-account events, see PutPermission. Input, InputPath, and InputTransformer are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event: When you specify InputPath or InputTransformer, you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation. When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect. This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that happens, FailedEntryCount is non-zero in the response and each entry in FailedEntries provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.",

      "description": "The targets to update or add to the rule. (dict) --- Targets are the resources to be invoked when a rule is triggered. For a complete list of services and resources that can be set as a target, see PutTargets. If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions in the Target structure. For more information, see Sending and Receiving Events Between Amazon Web Services Accounts in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide. The ID of the target within the specified rule. Use this ID to reference the target when updating the rule. We recommend using a memorable and unique string. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target. RoleArn (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be used for this target when the rule is triggered. If one rule triggers multiple targets, you can use a different IAM role for each target. Input (string) --- Valid JSON text passed to the target. In this case, nothing from the event itself is passed to the target. For more information, see The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format. InputPath (string) --- The value of the JSONPath that is used for extracting part of the matched event when passing it to the target. You may use JSON dot notation or bracket notation. For more information about JSON paths, see JSONPath. InputTransformer (dict) --- Settings to enable you to provide custom input to a target based on certain event data. You can extract one or more key-value pairs from the event and then use that data to send customized input to the target. InputPathsMap (dict) --- Map of JSON paths to be extracted from the event. You can then insert these in the template in InputTemplate to produce the output you want to be sent to the target. InputPathsMap is an array key-value pairs, where each value is a valid JSON path. You can have as many as 100 key-value pairs. You must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation. The keys cannot start with 'Amazon Web Services.' (string) --- (string) --- Input template where you specify placeholders that will be filled with the values of the keys from InputPathsMap to customize the data sent to the target. Enclose each InputPathsMaps value in brackets: <value> If InputTemplate is a JSON object (surrounded by curly braces), the following restrictions apply: The placeholder cannot be used as an object key. The following example shows the syntax for using InputPathsMap and InputTemplate. \"InputTransformer\": { \"InputPathsMap\": {\"instance\": \"$.detail.instance\",\"status\": \"$.detail.status\"}, \"InputTemplate\": \"<instance> is in state <status>\" } To have the InputTemplate include quote marks within a JSON string, escape each quote marks with a slash, as in the following example: \"InputTransformer\": { \"InputPathsMap\": {\"instance\": \"$.detail.instance\",\"status\": \"$.detail.status\"}, \"InputTemplate\": \"<instance> is in state \\\"<status>\\\"\" } The InputTemplate can also be valid JSON with varibles in quotes or out, as in the following example: \"InputTransformer\": { \"InputPathsMap\": {\"instance\": \"$.detail.instance\",\"status\": \"$.detail.status\"}, \"InputTemplate\": '{\"myInstance\": <instance>,\"myStatus\": \"<instance> is in state \\\"<status>\\\"\"}' } KinesisParameters (dict) --- The custom parameter you can use to control the shard assignment, when the target is a Kinesis data stream. If you do not include this parameter, the default is to use the eventId as the partition key. The JSON path to be extracted from the event and used as the partition key. For more information, see Amazon Kinesis Streams Key Concepts in the Amazon Kinesis Streams Developer Guide. RunCommandParameters (dict) --- Parameters used when you are using the rule to invoke Amazon EC2 Run Command. Currently, we support including only one RunCommandTarget block, which specifies either an array of InstanceIds or a tag. (dict) --- Information about the EC2 instances that are to be sent the command, specified as key-value pairs. Each RunCommandTarget block can include only one key, but this key may specify multiple values. Can be either tag: tag-key or InstanceIds. If Key is tag: tag-key, Values is a list of tag values. If Key is InstanceIds, Values is a list of Amazon EC2 instance IDs.

NetworkConfiguration (dict) --- Use this structure if the Amazon ECS task uses the awsvpc network mode. This structure specifies the VPC subnets and security groups associated with the task, and whether a public IP address is to be used. This structure is required if LaunchType is FARGATE because the awsvpc mode is required for Fargate tasks. If you specify NetworkConfiguration when the target ECS task does not use the awsvpc network mode, the task fails. awsvpcConfiguration (dict) --- Use this structure to specify the VPC subnets and security groups for the task, and whether a public IP address is to be used. This structure is relevant only for ECS tasks that use the awsvpc network mode. Specifies the subnets associated with the task. These subnets must all be in the same VPC. You can specify as many as 16 subnets. (string) --- SecurityGroups (list) --- Specifies the security groups associated with the task. These security groups must all be in the same VPC. You can specify as many as five security groups. If you do not specify a security group, the default security group for the VPC is used.

The weight value is taken into consideration after the base value, if defined, is satisfied. base (integer) --- The base value designates how many tasks, at a minimum, to run on the specified capacity provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity provider strategy can have a base defined. If no value is specified, the default value of 0 is used. EnableECSManagedTags (boolean) --- Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags for the task. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. EnableExecuteCommand (boolean) --- Whether or not to enable the execute command functionality for the containers in this task.

(dict) --- The task placement strategy for a task or service. To learn more, see Task Placement Strategies in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Service Developer Guide. type (string) --- The type of placement strategy. The random placement strategy randomly places tasks on available candidates. The spread placement strategy spreads placement across available candidates evenly based on the field parameter. The binpack strategy places tasks on available candidates that have the least available amount of the resource that is specified with the field parameter. For example, if you binpack on memory, a task is placed on the instance with the least amount of remaining memory (but still enough to run the task). field (string) --- The field to apply the placement strategy against. For the spread placement strategy, valid values are instanceId (or host, which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to a container instance, such as attribute:ecs.availability-zone. For the binpack placement strategy, valid values are cpu and memory. For the random placement strategy, this field is not used. PropagateTags (string) --- Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition to the task. If no value is specified, the tags are not propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the task during task creation. To add tags to a task after task creation, use the TagResource API action. ReferenceId (string) --- The reference ID to use for the task. Tags (list) --- The metadata that you apply to the task to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. To learn more, see RunTask in the Amazon ECS API Reference. (dict) --- A key-value pair associated with an Amazon Web Services resource. In EventBridge, rules and event buses support tagging. A string you can use to assign a value. The combination of tag keys and values can help you organize and categorize your resources. The value for the specified tag key. BatchParameters (dict) --- If the event target is an Batch job, this contains the job definition, job name, and other parameters. For more information, see Jobs in the Batch User Guide. The ARN or name of the job definition to use if the event target is an Batch job. This job definition must already exist. The name to use for this execution of the job, if the target is an Batch job. ArrayProperties (dict) --- The array properties for the submitted job, such as the size of the array. The array size can be between 2 and 10,000. If you specify array properties for a job, it becomes an array job. This parameter is used only if the target is an Batch job. Size (integer) --- The size of the array, if this is an array batch job. Valid values are integers between 2 and 10,000. RetryStrategy (dict) --- The retry strategy to use for failed jobs, if the target is an Batch job. The retry strategy is the number of times to retry the failed job execution. Valid values are 1---10. When you specify a retry strategy here, it overrides the retry strategy defined in the job definition. Attempts (integer) --- The number of times to attempt to retry, if the job fails. SqsParameters (dict) --- Contains the message group ID to use when the target is a FIFO queue. If you specify an SQS FIFO queue as a target, the queue must have content-based deduplication enabled. MessageGroupId (string) --- The FIFO message group ID to use as the target. HttpParameters (dict) --- Contains the HTTP parameters to use when the target is a API Gateway endpoint or EventBridge ApiDestination. If you specify an API Gateway API or EventBridge ApiDestination as a target, you can use this parameter to specify headers, path parameters, and query string keys/values as part of your target invoking request. If you're using ApiDestinations, the corresponding Connection can also have these values configured. In case of any conflicting keys, values from the Connection take precedence. PathParameterValues (list) --- The path parameter values to be used to populate API Gateway API or EventBridge ApiDestination path wildcards ('*'). (string) --- HeaderParameters (dict) --- The headers that need to be sent as part of request invoking the API Gateway API or EventBridge ApiDestination.

SecretManagerArn (string) --- The name or ARN of the secret that enables access to the database. Required when authenticating using Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. The name of the database. Required when authenticating using temporary credentials. DbUser (string) --- The database user name. Sql (string) --- The SQL statement text to run. StatementName (string) --- The name of the SQL statement. You can name the SQL statement when you create it to identify the query. WithEvent (boolean) --- Indicates whether to send an event back to EventBridge after the SQL statement runs. Sqls (list) --- One or more SQL statements to run. The SQL statements are run as a single transaction. They run serially in the order of the array. Subsequent SQL statements don't start until the previous statement in the array completes. If any SQL statement fails, then because they are run as one transaction, all work is rolled back. (string) --- A single Redshift SQL SageMakerPipelineParameters (dict) --- Contains the SageMaker AI Model Building Pipeline parameters to start execution of a SageMaker AI Model Building Pipeline. If you specify a SageMaker AI Model Building Pipeline as a target, you can use this to specify parameters to start a pipeline execution based on EventBridge events.
