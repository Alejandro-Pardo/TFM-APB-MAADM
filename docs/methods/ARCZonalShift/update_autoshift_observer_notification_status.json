  "description": "Update the status of autoshift observer notification. Autoshift observer notification enables you to be notified, through Amazon EventBridge, when there is an autoshift event for zonal autoshift. If the status is ENABLED, ARC includes all autoshift events when you use the EventBridge pattern Autoshift In Progress. When the status is DISABLED, ARC includes only autoshift events for autoshifts when one or more of your resources is included in the autoshift. For more information, see Notifications for practice runs and autoshifts in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.",
