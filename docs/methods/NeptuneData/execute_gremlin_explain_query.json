  "description": "Executes a Gremlin Explain query. Amazon Neptune has added a Gremlin feature named explain that provides is a self-service tool for understanding the execution approach being taken by the Neptune engine for the query. You invoke it by adding an explain parameter to an HTTP call that submits a Gremlin query. The explain feature provides information about the logical structure of query execution plans. You can use this information to identify potential evaluation and execution bottlenecks and to tune your query, as explained in Tuning Gremlin queries. You can also use query hints to improve query execution plans. When invoking this operation in a Neptune cluster that has IAM authentication enabled, the IAM user or role making the request must have a policy attached that allows one of the following IAM actions in that cluster, depending on the query: Note that the neptune-db:QueryLanguage:Gremlin IAM condition key can be used in the policy document to restrict the use of Gremlin queries (see Condition keys available in Neptune IAM data-access policy statements).",
