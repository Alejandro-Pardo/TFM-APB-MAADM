If this value is used, the bulk loader takes up all available resources. This does not mean, however, that the OVERSUBSCRIBE setting results in 100% CPU utilization. Because the load operation is I/O bound, the highest CPU utilization to expect is in the 60% to 70% range.

It's useful to provide relationship IDs explicitly so that the loader can resume loading after error in the CSV data have been fixed, without having to reload any relationships that have already been loaded. If relationship IDs have not been explicitly assigned, the loader cannot resume a failed load if any relationship file has had to be corrected, and must instead reload all the relationships.",
