      "description": "The resource name for which to modify the account setting. The following are the valid values for the account setting name. serviceLongArnFormat - When modified, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging. taskLongArnFormat - When modified, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. containerInstanceLongArnFormat - When modified, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. awsvpcTrunking - When modified, the elastic network interface (ENI) limit for any new container instances that support the feature is changed. If awsvpcTrunking is turned on, any new container instances that support the feature are launched have the increased ENI limits available to them. For more information, see Elastic Network Interface Trunking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. containerInsights - Container Insights with enhanced observability provides all the Container Insights metrics, plus additional task and container metrics. This version supports enhanced observability for Amazon ECS clusters using the Amazon EC2 and Fargate launch types. After you configure Container Insights with enhanced observability on Amazon ECS, Container Insights auto-collects detailed infrastructure telemetry from the cluster level down to the container level in your environment and displays these critical performance data in curated dashboards removing the heavy lifting in observability set-up. To use Container Insights with enhanced observability, set the containerInsights account setting to enhanced. To use Container Insights, set the containerInsights account setting to enabled. For more information, see Monitor Amazon ECS containers using Container Insights with enhanced observability in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. dualStackIPv6 - When turned on, when using a VPC in dual stack mode, your tasks using the awsvpc network mode can have an IPv6 address assigned. For more information on using IPv6 with tasks launched on Amazon EC2 instances, see Using a VPC in dual-stack mode. For more information on using IPv6 with tasks launched on Fargate, see Using a VPC in dual-stack mode. fargateFIPSMode - If you specify fargateFIPSMode, Fargate FIPS 140 compliance is affected. fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod - When Amazon Web Services determines that a security or infrastructure update is needed for an Amazon ECS task hosted on Fargate, the tasks need to be stopped and new tasks launched to replace them. Use fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod to configure the wait time to retire a Fargate task. For information about the Fargate tasks maintenance, see Amazon Web Services Fargate task maintenance in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide. tagResourceAuthorization - Amazon ECS is introducing tagging authorization for resource creation. Users must have permissions for actions that create the resource, such as ecsCreateCluster. If tags are specified when you create a resource, Amazon Web Services performs additional authorization to verify if users or roles have permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must grant explicit permissions to use the ecs:TagResource action. For more information, see Grant permission to tag resources on creation in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide. defaultLogDriverMode -Amazon ECS supports setting a default delivery mode of log messages from a container to the logDriver that you specify in the container's logConfiguration. The delivery mode affects application stability when the flow of logs from the container to the log driver is interrupted. The defaultLogDriverMode setting supports two values: blocking and non-blocking. If you don't specify a delivery mode in your container definition's logConfiguration, the mode you specify using this account setting will be used as the default. For more information about log delivery modes, see LogConfiguration. guardDutyActivate - The guardDutyActivate parameter is read-only in Amazon ECS and indicates whether Amazon ECS Runtime Monitoring is enabled or disabled by your security administrator in your Amazon ECS account. Amazon GuardDuty controls this account setting on your behalf. For more information, see Protecting Amazon ECS workloads with Amazon ECS Runtime Monitoring.",
