      "description": "An object that represent the parameters to update for the Auto Scaling group capacity provider. managedScaling (dict) --- The managed scaling settings for the Auto Scaling group capacity provider. status (string) --- Determines whether to use managed scaling for the capacity provider. targetCapacity (integer) --- The target capacity utilization as a percentage for the capacity provider. The specified value must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100. For example, if you want the capacity provider to maintain 10% spare capacity, then that means the utilization is 90%, so use a targetCapacity of 90. The default value of 100 percent results in the Amazon EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group being completely used. minimumScalingStepSize (integer) --- The minimum number of Amazon EC2 instances that Amazon ECS will scale out at one time. The scale in process is not affected by this parameter If this parameter is omitted, the default value of 1 is used. When additional capacity is required, Amazon ECS will scale up the minimum scaling step size even if the actual demand is less than the minimum scaling step size. If you use a capacity provider with an Auto Scaling group configured with more than one Amazon EC2 instance type or Availability Zone, Amazon ECS will scale up by the exact minimum scaling step size value and will ignore both the maximum scaling step size as well as the capacity demand. maximumScalingStepSize (integer) --- The maximum number of Amazon EC2 instances that Amazon ECS will scale out at one time. If this parameter is omitted, the default value of 10000 is used. instanceWarmupPeriod (integer) --- The period of time, in seconds, after a newly launched Amazon EC2 instance can contribute to CloudWatch metrics for Auto Scaling group. If this parameter is omitted, the default value of 300 seconds is used. managedTerminationProtection (string) --- The managed termination protection setting to use for the Auto Scaling group capacity provider. This determines whether the Auto Scaling group has managed termination protection. When managed termination protection is on, Amazon ECS prevents the Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group that contain tasks from being terminated during a scale-in action. The Auto Scaling group and each instance in the Auto Scaling group must have instance protection from scale-in actions on. For more information, see Instance Protection in the Auto Scaling User Guide. When managed termination protection is off, your Amazon EC2 instances aren't protected from termination when the Auto Scaling group scales in. managedDraining (string) --- The managed draining option for the Auto Scaling group capacity provider. When you enable this, Amazon ECS manages and gracefully drains the EC2 container instances that are in the Auto Scaling group capacity provider.",
