For Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate, the awsvpc network mode is required. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Linux instances, any network mode can be used. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Windows instances, <default> or awsvpc can be used. If the network mode is set to none, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The host and awsvpc network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the bridge mode. With the host and awsvpc network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the host network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the awsvpc network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings. If the network mode is awsvpc, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration value when you create a service or run a task with the task definition.

      "type": "list",
      "required": true,
      "description": "A list of container definitions in JSON format that describe the different containers that make up your task. (dict) --- Container definitions are used in task definitions to describe the different containers that are launched as part of a task. name (string) --- The name of a container. If you're linking multiple containers together in a task definition, the name of one container can be entered in the links of another container to connect the containers. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. This parameter maps to name in the docker container create command and the --name option to docker run. image (string) --- The image used to start a container. This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. By default, images in the Docker Hub registry are available. Other repositories are specified with either repository-url/image:tag or repository-url/image@digest ``. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed. This parameter maps to ``Image in the docker container create command and the IMAGE parameter of docker run. When a new task starts, the Amazon ECS container agent pulls the latest version of the specified image and tag for the container to use. However, subsequent updates to a repository image aren't propagated to already running tasks. Images in Amazon ECR repositories can be specified by either using the full registry/repository:tag or registry/repository@digest. For example, 012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:latest or 012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>@sha256:94afd1f2e64d908bc90dbca0035a5b567EXAMPLE. Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, ubuntu or mongo). Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, amazon/amazon-ecs-agent). Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu). repositoryCredentials (dict) --- The private repository authentication credentials to use. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret containing the private repository credentials. cpu (integer) --- The number of cpu units reserved for the container. This parameter maps to CpuShares in the docker container create commandand the --cpu-shares option to docker run. This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and the only requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task be lower than the task-level cpu value. Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that's the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task is guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed. Moreover, each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it. If both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units. On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2, and the maximum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 262144. However, the CPU parameter isn't required, and you can use CPU values below 2 or above 262144 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null) or above 262144, the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version: Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0: Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares. Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0: Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2. Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.84.0: CPU values greater than 256 vCPU are passed to Docker as 256, which is equivalent to 262144 CPU shares. On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit, or a quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU that's described in the task definition. A null or zero CPU value is passed to Docker as 0, which Windows interprets as 1% of one CPU. memory (integer) --- The amount (in MiB) of memory to present to the container. If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified here, the container is killed. The total amount of memory reserved for all containers within a task must be lower than the task memory value, if one is specified. This parameter maps to Memory in the docker container create command and the --memory option to docker run. If using the Fargate launch type, this parameter is optional. If using the EC2 launch type, you must specify either a task-level memory value or a container-level memory value. If you specify both a container-level memory and memoryReservation value, memory must be greater than memoryReservation. If you specify memoryReservation, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance where the container is placed. Otherwise, the value of memory is used. The Docker 20.10.0 or later daemon reserves a minimum of 6 MiB of memory for a container. So, don't specify less than 6 MiB of memory for your containers. The Docker 19.03.13-ce or earlier daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB of memory for a container. So, don't specify less than 4 MiB of memory for your containers. memoryReservation (integer) --- The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When system memory is under heavy contention, Docker attempts to keep the container memory to this soft limit. However, your container can consume more memory when it needs to, up to either the hard limit specified with the memory parameter (if applicable), or all of the available memory on the container instance, whichever comes first. This parameter maps to MemoryReservation in the docker container create command and the --memory-reservation option to docker run. If a task-level memory value is not specified, you must specify a non-zero integer for one or both of memory or memoryReservation in a container definition. If you specify both, memory must be greater than memoryReservation. For example, if your container normally uses 128 MiB of memory, but occasionally bursts to 256 MiB of memory for short periods of time, you can set a memoryReservation of 128 MiB, and a memory hard limit of 300 MiB. This configuration would allow the container to only reserve 128 MiB of memory from the remaining resources on the container instance, but also allow the container to consume more memory resources when needed. links (list) --- The links parameter allows containers to communicate with each other without the need for port mappings. This parameter is only supported if the network mode of a task definition is bridge. The name:internalName construct is analogous to name:alias in Docker links. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed.. This parameter maps to Links in the docker container create command and the --link option to docker run. (string) --- portMappings (list) --- The list of port mappings for the container. Port mappings allow containers to access ports on the host container instance to send or receive traffic. For task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode, only specify the containerPort. The hostPort can be left blank or it must be the same value as the containerPort. Port mappings on Windows use the NetNAT gateway address rather than localhost. There's no loopback for port mappings on Windows, so you can't access a container's mapped port from the host itself. This parameter maps to PortBindings in the the docker container create command and the --publish option to docker run. If the network mode of a task definition is set to none, then you can't specify port mappings. If the network mode of a task definition is set to host, then host ports must either be undefined or they must match the container port in the port mapping. (dict) --- Port mappings allow containers to access ports on the host container instance to send or receive traffic. Port mappings are specified as part of the container definition. If you use containers in a task with the awsvpc or host network mode, specify the exposed ports using containerPort. Most fields of this parameter ( containerPort, hostPort, protocol) maps to PortBindings in the docker container create command and the --publish option to docker run. If the network mode of a task definition is set to host, host ports must either be undefined or match the container port in the port mapping. After a task reaches the RUNNING status, manual and automatic host and container port assignments are visible in the networkBindings section of DescribeTasks API responses. containerPort (integer) --- The port number on the container that's bound to the user-specified or automatically assigned host port. If you use containers in a task with the bridge network mode and you specify a container port and not a host port, your container automatically receives a host port in the ephemeral port range. For more information, see hostPort. Port mappings that are automatically assigned in this way do not count toward the 100 reserved ports limit of a container instance. hostPort (integer) --- The port number on the container instance to reserve for your container. If you specify a containerPortRange, leave this field empty and the value of the hostPort is set as follows: For containers in a task with the awsvpc network mode, the hostPort is set to the same value as the containerPort. This is a static mapping strategy. For containers in a task with the bridge network mode, the Amazon ECS agent finds open ports on the host and automatically binds them to the container ports. This is a dynamic mapping strategy. If you use containers in a task with the awsvpc or host network mode, the hostPort can either be left blank or set to the same value as the containerPort. If you use containers in a task with the bridge network mode, you can specify a non-reserved host port for your container port mapping, or you can omit the hostPort (or set it to 0) while specifying a containerPort and your container automatically receives a port in the ephemeral port range for your container instance operating system and Docker version. The default ephemeral port range for Docker version 1.6.0 and later is listed on the instance under /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range. If this kernel parameter is unavailable, the default ephemeral port range from 49153 through 65535 (Linux) or 49152 through 65535 (Windows) is used. Do not attempt to specify a host port in the ephemeral port range as these are reserved for automatic assignment. In general, ports below 32768 are outside of the ephemeral port range. The default reserved ports are 22 for SSH, the Docker ports 2375 and 2376, and the Amazon ECS container agent ports 51678-51680. Any host port that was previously specified in a running task is also reserved while the task is running. That is, after a task stops, the host port is released. The current reserved ports are displayed in the remainingResources of DescribeContainerInstances output. A container instance can have up to 100 reserved ports at a time. This number includes the default reserved ports. Automatically assigned ports aren't included in the 100 reserved ports quota. protocol (string) --- The protocol used for the port mapping. Valid values are tcp and udp. The default is tcp. protocol is immutable in a Service Connect service. Updating this field requires a service deletion and redeployment. name (string) --- The name that's used for the port mapping. This parameter is the name that you use in the serviceConnectConfiguration and the vpcLatticeConfigurations of a service. The name can include up to 64 characters. The characters can include lowercase letters, numbers, underscores (_), and hyphens (-). The name can't start with a hyphen. appProtocol (string) --- The application protocol that's used for the port mapping. This parameter only applies to Service Connect. We recommend that you set this parameter to be consistent with the protocol that your application uses. If you set this parameter, Amazon ECS adds protocol-specific connection handling to the Service Connect proxy. If you set this parameter, Amazon ECS adds protocol-specific telemetry in the Amazon ECS console and CloudWatch. If you don't set a value for this parameter, then TCP is used. However, Amazon ECS doesn't add protocol-specific telemetry for TCP. appProtocol is immutable in a Service Connect service. Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service Connect. For more information, see Service Connect in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. containerPortRange (string) --- The port number range on the container that's bound to the dynamically mapped host port range. The following rules apply when you specify a containerPortRange: You must use either the bridge network mode or the awsvpc network mode. This parameter is available for both the EC2 and Fargate launch types. This parameter is available for both the Linux and Windows operating systems. The container instance must have at least version 1.67.0 of the container agent and at least version 1.67.0-1 of the ecs-init package You can specify a maximum of 100 port ranges per container. You do not specify a hostPortRange. The value of the hostPortRange is set as follows: For containers in a task with the awsvpc network mode, the hostPortRange is set to the same value as the containerPortRange. For containers in a task with the bridge network mode, the Amazon ECS agent finds open host ports from the default ephemeral range and passes it to docker to bind them to the container ports. The containerPortRange valid values are between 1 and 65535. A port can only be included in one port mapping per container. You cannot specify overlapping port ranges. The first port in the range must be less than last port in the range. Docker recommends that you turn off the docker-proxy in the Docker daemon config file when you have a large number of ports. For more information, see Issue #11185 on the Github website. For information about how to turn off the docker-proxy in the Docker daemon config file, see Docker daemon in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide. You can call DescribeTasks to view the hostPortRange which are the host ports that are bound to the container ports. essential (boolean) --- If the essential parameter of a container is marked as true, and that container fails or stops for any reason, all other containers that are part of the task are stopped. If the essential parameter of a container is marked as false, its failure doesn't affect the rest of the containers in a task. If this parameter is omitted, a container is assumed to be essential. All tasks must have at least one essential container. If you have an application that's composed of multiple containers, group containers that are used for a common purpose into components, and separate the different components into multiple task definitions. For more information, see Application Architecture in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. restartPolicy (dict) --- The restart policy for a container. When you set up a restart policy, Amazon ECS can restart the container without needing to replace the task. For more information, see Restart individual containers in Amazon ECS tasks with container restart policies in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Specifies whether a restart policy is enabled for the container. ignoredExitCodes (list) --- A list of exit codes that Amazon ECS will ignore and not attempt a restart on. You can specify a maximum of 50 container exit codes. By default, Amazon ECS does not ignore any exit codes. (integer) --- restartAttemptPeriod (integer) --- A period of time (in seconds) that the container must run for before a restart can be attempted. A container can be restarted only once every restartAttemptPeriod seconds. If a container isn't able to run for this time period and exits early, it will not be restarted. You can set a minimum restartAttemptPeriod of 60 seconds and a maximum restartAttemptPeriod of 1800 seconds. By default, a container must run for 300 seconds before it can be restarted. entryPoint (list) --- The entry point that's passed to the container. This parameter maps to Entrypoint in the docker container create command and the --entrypoint option to docker run. (string) --- command (list) --- The command that's passed to the container. This parameter maps to Cmd in the docker container create command and the COMMAND parameter to docker run. If there are multiple arguments, each argument is a separated string in the array. (string) --- environment (list) --- The environment variables to pass to a container. This parameter maps to Env in the docker container create command and the --env option to docker run. (dict) --- A key-value pair object. name (string) --- The name of the key-value pair. For environment variables, this is the name of the environment variable. value (string) --- The value of the key-value pair. For environment variables, this is the value of the environment variable. environmentFiles (list) --- A list of files containing the environment variables to pass to a container. This parameter maps to the --env-file option to docker run. You can specify up to ten environment files. The file must have a .env file extension. Each line in an environment file contains an environment variable in VARIABLE=VALUE format. Lines beginning with # are treated as comments and are ignored. If there are environment variables specified using the environment parameter in a container definition, they take precedence over the variables contained within an environment file. If multiple environment files are specified that contain the same variable, they're processed from the top down. We recommend that you use unique variable names. For more information, see Specifying Environment Variables in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. (dict) --- A list of files containing the environment variables to pass to a container. Each line in an environment file should contain an environment variable in VARIABLE=VALUE format. For more information, see Use a file to pass environment variables to a container in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Environment variable files are objects in Amazon S3 and all Amazon S3 security considerations apply. You must use the following platforms for the Fargate launch type: Linux platform version 1.4.0 or later. Windows platform version 1.0.0 or later. Consider the following when using the Fargate launch type: The file is handled like a native Docker env-file. There is no support for shell escape handling. The container entry point interperts the VARIABLE values. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon S3 object containing the environment variable file. The file type to use. Environment files are objects in Amazon S3. The only supported value is s3. mountPoints (list) --- The mount points for data volumes in your container. This parameter maps to Volumes in the docker container create command and the --volume option to docker run. Windows containers can mount whole directories on the same drive as $env:ProgramData. Windows containers can't mount directories on a different drive, and mount point can't be across drives. (dict) --- The details for a volume mount point that's used in a container definition. sourceVolume (string) --- The name of the volume to mount. Must be a volume name referenced in the name parameter of task definition volume. containerPath (string) --- The path on the container to mount the host volume at. readOnly (boolean) --- If this value is true, the container has read-only access to the volume. If this value is false, then the container can write to the volume. The default value is false. volumesFrom (list) --- Data volumes to mount from another container. This parameter maps to VolumesFrom in the docker container create command and the --volumes-from option to docker run. (dict) --- Details on a data volume from another container in the same task definition. sourceContainer (string) --- The name of another container within the same task definition to mount volumes from. linuxParameters (dict) --- Linux-specific modifications that are applied to the default Docker container configuration, such as Linux kernel capabilities. For more information see KernelCapabilities. capabilities (dict) --- The Linux capabilities for the container that are added to or dropped from the default configuration provided by Docker. add (list) --- The Linux capabilities for the container that have been added to the default configuration provided by Docker. This parameter maps to CapAdd in the docker container create command and the --cap-add option to docker run. Valid values: \"ALL\" | \"AUDIT_CONTROL\" | \"AUDIT_WRITE\" | \"BLOCK_SUSPEND\" | \"CHOWN\" | \"DAC_OVERRIDE\" | \"DAC_READ_SEARCH\" | \"FOWNER\" | \"FSETID\" | \"IPC_LOCK\" | \"IPC_OWNER\" | \"KILL\" | \"LEASE\" | \"LINUX_IMMUTABLE\" | \"MAC_ADMIN\" | \"MAC_OVERRIDE\" | \"MKNOD\" | \"NET_ADMIN\" | \"NET_BIND_SERVICE\" | \"NET_BROADCAST\" | \"NET_RAW\" | \"SETFCAP\" | \"SETGID\" | \"SETPCAP\" | \"SETUID\" | \"SYS_ADMIN\" | \"SYS_BOOT\" | \"SYS_CHROOT\" | \"SYS_MODULE\" | \"SYS_NICE\" | \"SYS_PACCT\" | \"SYS_PTRACE\" | \"SYS_RAWIO\" | \"SYS_RESOURCE\" | \"SYS_TIME\" | \"SYS_TTY_CONFIG\" | \"SYSLOG\" | \"WAKE_ALARM\" (string) --- drop (list) --- The Linux capabilities for the container that have been removed from the default configuration provided by Docker. This parameter maps to CapDrop in the docker container create command and the --cap-drop option to docker run. Valid values: \"ALL\" | \"AUDIT_CONTROL\" | \"AUDIT_WRITE\" | \"BLOCK_SUSPEND\" | \"CHOWN\" | \"DAC_OVERRIDE\" | \"DAC_READ_SEARCH\" | \"FOWNER\" | \"FSETID\" | \"IPC_LOCK\" | \"IPC_OWNER\" | \"KILL\" | \"LEASE\" | \"LINUX_IMMUTABLE\" | \"MAC_ADMIN\" | \"MAC_OVERRIDE\" | \"MKNOD\" | \"NET_ADMIN\" | \"NET_BIND_SERVICE\" | \"NET_BROADCAST\" | \"NET_RAW\" | \"SETFCAP\" | \"SETGID\" | \"SETPCAP\" | \"SETUID\" | \"SYS_ADMIN\" | \"SYS_BOOT\" | \"SYS_CHROOT\" | \"SYS_MODULE\" | \"SYS_NICE\" | \"SYS_PACCT\" | \"SYS_PTRACE\" | \"SYS_RAWIO\" | \"SYS_RESOURCE\" | \"SYS_TIME\" | \"SYS_TTY_CONFIG\" | \"SYSLOG\" | \"WAKE_ALARM\" (string) --- devices (list) --- Any host devices to expose to the container. This parameter maps to Devices in the docker container create command and the --device option to docker run. (dict) --- An object representing a container instance host device. The path for the device on the host container instance. containerPath (string) --- The path inside the container at which to expose the host device. permissions (list) --- The explicit permissions to provide to the container for the device. By default, the container has permissions for read, write, and mknod for the device. (string) --- initProcessEnabled (boolean) --- Run an init process inside the container that forwards signals and reaps processes. This parameter maps to the --init option to docker run. This parameter requires version 1.25 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}' sharedMemorySize (integer) --- The value for the size (in MiB) of the /dev/shm volume. This parameter maps to the --shm-size option to docker run. tmpfs (list) --- The container path, mount options, and size (in MiB) of the tmpfs mount. This parameter maps to the --tmpfs option to docker run. (dict) --- The container path, mount options, and size of the tmpfs mount. The absolute file path where the tmpfs volume is to be mounted. The maximum size (in MiB) of the tmpfs volume. mountOptions (list) --- The list of tmpfs volume mount options. Valid values: \"defaults\" | \"ro\" | \"rw\" | \"suid\" | \"nosuid\" | \"dev\" | \"nodev\" | \"exec\" | \"noexec\" | \"sync\" | \"async\" | \"dirsync\" | \"remount\" | \"mand\" | \"nomand\" | \"atime\" | \"noatime\" | \"diratime\" | \"nodiratime\" | \"bind\" | \"rbind\" | \"unbindable\" | \"runbindable\" | \"private\" | \"rprivate\" | \"shared\" | \"rshared\" | \"slave\" | \"rslave\" | \"relatime\" | \"norelatime\" | \"strictatime\" | \"nostrictatime\" | \"mode\" | \"uid\" | \"gid\" | \"nr_inodes\" | \"nr_blocks\" | \"mpol\" (string) --- maxSwap (integer) --- The total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use. This parameter will be translated to the --memory-swap option to docker run where the value would be the sum of the container memory plus the maxSwap value. If a maxSwap value of 0 is specified, the container will not use swap. Accepted values are 0 or any positive integer. If the maxSwap parameter is omitted, the container will use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A maxSwap value must be set for the swappiness parameter to be used. swappiness (integer) --- This allows you to tune a container's memory swappiness behavior. A swappiness value of 0 will cause swapping to not happen unless absolutely necessary. A swappiness value of 100 will cause pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between 0 and 100. If the swappiness parameter is not specified, a default value of 60 is used. If a value is not specified for maxSwap then this parameter is ignored. This parameter maps to the --memory-swappiness option to docker run. secrets (list) --- The secrets to pass to the container. For more information, see Specifying Sensitive Data in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. (dict) --- An object representing the secret to expose to your container. Secrets can be exposed to a container in the following ways: To inject sensitive data into your containers as environment variables, use the secrets container definition parameter. To reference sensitive information in the log configuration of a container, use the secretOptions container definition parameter. For more information, see Specifying sensitive data in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. The name of the secret. The secret to expose to the container. The supported values are either the full ARN of the Secrets Manager secret or the full ARN of the parameter in the SSM Parameter Store. For information about the require Identity and Access Management permissions, see Required IAM permissions for Amazon ECS secrets (for Secrets Manager) or Required IAM permissions for Amazon ECS secrets (for Systems Manager Parameter store) in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. dependsOn (list) --- The dependencies defined for container startup and shutdown. A container can contain multiple dependencies on other containers in a task definition. When a dependency is defined for container startup, for container shutdown it is reversed. For tasks using the EC2 launch type, the container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent to turn on container dependencies. However, we recommend using the latest container agent version. For information about checking your agent version and updating to the latest version, see Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If you're using an Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI, your instance needs at least version 1.26.0-1 of the ecs-init package. If your container instances are launched from version 20190301 or later, then they contain the required versions of the container agent and ecs-init. For more information, see Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. For tasks using the Fargate launch type, the task or service requires the following platforms: Linux platform version 1.3.0 or later. (dict) --- The dependencies defined for container startup and shutdown. A container can contain multiple dependencies. Your Amazon ECS container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent to use container dependencies. For more information about how to create a container dependency, see Container dependency in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. The name of a container. The dependency condition of the container. The following are the available conditions and their behavior: START - This condition emulates the behavior of links and volumes today. It validates that a dependent container is started before permitting other containers to start. COMPLETE - This condition validates that a dependent container runs to completion (exits) before permitting other containers to start. This can be useful for nonessential containers that run a script and then exit. This condition can't be set on an essential container. SUCCESS - This condition is the same as COMPLETE, but it also requires that the container exits with a zero status. HEALTHY - This condition validates that the dependent container passes its Docker health check before permitting other containers to start. This requires that the dependent container has health checks configured. This condition is confirmed only at task startup. startTimeout (integer) --- Time duration (in seconds) to wait before giving up on resolving dependencies for a container. For example, you specify two containers in a task definition with containerA having a dependency on containerB reaching a COMPLETE, SUCCESS, or HEALTHY status. If a startTimeout value is specified for containerB and it doesn't reach the desired status within that time then containerA gives up and not start. This results in the task transitioning to a STOPPED state. For tasks using the EC2 launch type, your container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent to use a container start timeout value. The valid values for Fargate are 2-120 seconds. stopTimeout (integer) --- Time duration (in seconds) to wait before the container is forcefully killed if it doesn't exit normally on its own. For tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the max stop timeout value is 120 seconds and if the parameter is not specified, the default value of 30 seconds is used. For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, if the stopTimeout parameter isn't specified, the value set for the Amazon ECS container agent configuration variable ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT is used. If neither the stopTimeout parameter or the ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT agent configuration variable are set, then the default values of 30 seconds for Linux containers and 30 seconds on Windows containers are used. Your container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent to use a container stop timeout value. versionConsistency (string) --- Specifies whether Amazon ECS will resolve the container image tag provided in the container definition to an image digest. By default, the value is enabled. If you set the value for a container as disabled, Amazon ECS will not resolve the provided container image tag to a digest and will use the original image URI specified in the container definition for deployment. For more information about container image resolution, see Container image resolution in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide. hostname (string) --- The hostname to use for your container. This parameter maps to Hostname in the docker container create command and the --hostname option to docker run. user (string) --- The user to use inside the container. This parameter maps to User in the docker container create command and the --user option to docker run. You can specify the user using the following formats. If specifying a UID or GID, you must specify it as a positive integer. user user:group uid uid:gid user:gid uid:group workingDirectory (string) --- The working directory to run commands inside the container in. This parameter maps to WorkingDir in the docker container create command and the --workdir option to docker run. disableNetworking (boolean) --- When this parameter is true, networking is off within the container. This parameter maps to NetworkDisabled in the docker container create command. privileged (boolean) --- When this parameter is true, the container is given elevated privileges on the host container instance (similar to the root user). This parameter maps to Privileged in the docker container create command and the --privileged option to docker run readonlyRootFilesystem (boolean) --- When this parameter is true, the container is given read-only access to its root file system. This parameter maps to ReadonlyRootfs in the docker container create command and the --read-only option to docker run. dnsServers (list) --- A list of DNS servers that are presented to the container. This parameter maps to Dns in the docker container create command and the --dns option to docker run. (string) --- dnsSearchDomains (list) --- A list of DNS search domains that are presented to the container. This parameter maps to DnsSearch in the docker container create command and the --dns-search option to docker run. (string) --- extraHosts (list) --- A list of hostnames and IP address mappings to append to the /etc/hosts file on the container. This parameter maps to ExtraHosts in the docker container create command and the --add-host option to docker run. (dict) --- Hostnames and IP address entries that are added to the /etc/hosts file of a container via the extraHosts parameter of its ContainerDefinition. The hostname to use in the /etc/hosts entry. The IP address to use in the /etc/hosts entry. dockerSecurityOptions (list) --- A list of strings to provide custom configuration for multiple security systems. This field isn't valid for containers in tasks using the Fargate launch type. For Linux tasks on EC2, this parameter can be used to reference custom labels for SELinux and AppArmor multi-level security systems. For any tasks on EC2, this parameter can be used to reference a credential spec file that configures a container for Active Directory authentication. For more information, see Using gMSAs for Windows Containers and Using gMSAs for Linux Containers in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. This parameter maps to SecurityOpt in the docker container create command and the --security-opt option to docker run. Valid values: 'no-new-privileges' | 'apparmor:PROFILE' | 'label:value' | 'credentialspec:CredentialSpecFilePath' (string) --- interactive (boolean) --- When this parameter is true, you can deploy containerized applications that require stdin or a tty to be allocated. This parameter maps to OpenStdin in the docker container create command and the --interactive option to docker run. pseudoTerminal (boolean) --- When this parameter is true, a TTY is allocated. This parameter maps to Tty in the docker container create command and the --tty option to docker run. dockerLabels (dict) --- A key/value map of labels to add to the container. This parameter maps to Labels in the docker container create command and the --label option to docker run. This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}' (string) --- (string) --- ulimits (list) --- A list of ulimits to set in the container. If a ulimit value is specified in a task definition, it overrides the default values set by Docker. This parameter maps to Ulimits in the docker container create command and the --ulimit option to docker run. Valid naming values are displayed in the Ulimit data type. Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate use the default resource limit values set by the operating system with the exception of the nofile resource limit parameter which Fargate overrides. The nofile resource limit sets a restriction on the number of open files that a container can use. The default nofile soft limit is 65535 and the default hard limit is 65535. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}' (dict) --- The ulimit settings to pass to the container. You can specify the ulimit settings for a container in a task definition. The type of the ulimit. The soft limit for the ulimit type. The value can be specified in bytes, seconds, or as a count, depending on the type of the ulimit. The hard limit for the ulimit type. logConfiguration (dict) --- The log configuration specification for the container. This parameter maps to LogConfig in the docker container create command and the --log-driver option to docker run. By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container can use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}' The log driver to use for the container. For tasks on Fargate, the supported log drivers are awslogs, splunk, and awsfirelens. For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the supported log drivers are awslogs, fluentd, gelf, json-file, journald, syslog, splunk, and awsfirelens. For more information about using the awslogs log driver, see Send Amazon ECS logs to CloudWatch in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. For more information about using the awsfirelens log driver, see Send Amazon ECS logs to an Amazon Web Services service or Amazon Web Services Partner. options (dict) --- The configuration options to send to the log driver. The options you can specify depend on the log driver. Some of the options you can specify when you use the awslogs log driver to route logs to Amazon CloudWatch include the following: awslogs-create-group Required: No Specify whether you want the log group to be created automatically. If this option isn't specified, it defaults to false. Required: Yes Specify the Amazon Web Services Region that the awslogs log driver is to send your Docker logs to. You can choose to send all of your logs from clusters in different Regions to a single region in CloudWatch Logs. This is so that they're all visible in one location. Otherwise, you can separate them by Region for more granularity. Make sure that the specified log group exists in the Region that you specify with this option. awslogs-group Required: Yes Make sure to specify a log group that the awslogs log driver sends its log streams to. awslogs-stream-prefix Required: Yes, when using Fargate.Optional when using EC2. Use the awslogs-stream-prefix option to associate a log stream with the specified prefix, the container name, and the ID of the Amazon ECS task that the container belongs to. If you specify a prefix with this option, then the log stream takes the format prefix-name/container-name/ecs-task-id. If you don't specify a prefix with this option, then the log stream is named after the container ID that's assigned by the Docker daemon on the container instance. Because it's difficult to trace logs back to the container that sent them with just the Docker container ID (which is only available on the container instance), we recommend that you specify a prefix with this option. For Amazon ECS services, you can use the service name as the prefix. Doing so, you can trace log streams to the service that the container belongs to, the name of the container that sent them, and the ID of the task that the container belongs to. You must specify a stream-prefix for your logs to have your logs appear in the Log pane when using the Amazon ECS console. awslogs-datetime-format Required: No This option defines a multiline start pattern in Python strftime format. A log message consists of a line that matches the pattern and any following lines that don't match the pattern. The matched line is the delimiter between log messages. One example of a use case for using this format is for parsing output such as a stack dump, which might otherwise be logged in multiple entries. The correct pattern allows it to be captured in a single entry. For more information, see awslogs-datetime-format. You cannot configure both the awslogs-datetime-format and awslogs-multiline-pattern options. Required: No This option defines a multiline start pattern that uses a regular expression. For more information, see awslogs-multiline-pattern. This option is ignored if awslogs-datetime-format is also configured. The following options apply to all supported log drivers. mode Required: No Valid values: non-blocking | blocking This option defines the delivery mode of log messages from the container to the log driver specified using logDriver. The delivery mode you choose affects application availability when the flow of logs from container is interrupted. If you use the blocking mode and the flow of logs is interrupted, calls from container code to write to the stdout and stderr streams will block. The logging thread of the application will block as a result. This may cause the application to become unresponsive and lead to container healthcheck failure. If you use the non-blocking mode, the container's logs are instead stored in an in-memory intermediate buffer configured with the max-buffer-size option. This prevents the application from becoming unresponsive when logs cannot be sent. We recommend using this mode if you want to ensure service availability and are okay with some log loss. For more information, see Preventing log loss with non-blocking mode in the awslogs container log driver. You can set a default mode for all containers in a specific Amazon Web Services Region by using the defaultLogDriverMode account setting. If you don't specify the mode option or configure the account setting, Amazon ECS will default to the blocking mode. For more information about the account setting, see Default log driver mode in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. max-buffer-size Required: No Default value: 1m When non-blocking mode is used, the max-buffer-size log option controls the size of the buffer that's used for intermediate message storage. Make sure to specify an adequate buffer size based on your application. When the buffer fills up, further logs cannot be stored. Logs that cannot be stored are lost. To route logs using the splunk log router, you need to specify a splunk-token and a splunk-url. When you use the awsfirelens log router to route logs to an Amazon Web Services Service or Amazon Web Services Partner Network destination for log storage and analytics, you can set the log-driver-buffer-limit option to limit the number of events that are buffered in memory, before being sent to the log router container. It can help to resolve potential log loss issue because high throughput might result in memory running out for the buffer inside of Docker. Other options you can specify when using awsfirelens to route logs depend on the destination. When you export logs to Amazon Data Firehose, you can specify the Amazon Web Services Region with region and a name for the log stream with delivery_stream. When you export logs to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, you can specify an Amazon Web Services Region with region and a data stream name with stream. When you export logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service, you can specify options like Name, Host (OpenSearch Service endpoint without protocol), Port, Index, Type, Aws_auth, Aws_region, Suppress_Type_Name, and tls. For more information, see Under the hood: FireLens for Amazon ECS Tasks. When you export logs to Amazon S3, you can specify the bucket using the bucket option. You can also specify region, total_file_size, upload_timeout, and use_put_object as options. This parameter requires version 1.19 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}' (string) --- (string) --- secretOptions (list) --- The secrets to pass to the log configuration. healthCheck (dict) --- The container health check command and associated configuration parameters for the container. This parameter maps to HealthCheck in the docker container create command and the HEALTHCHECK parameter of docker run. A string array representing the command that the container runs to determine if it is healthy. The string array must start with CMD to run the command arguments directly, or CMD-SHELL to run the command with the container's default shell. When you use the Amazon Web Services Management Console JSON panel, the Command Line Interface, or the APIs, enclose the list of commands in double quotes and brackets. [ \"CMD-SHELL\", \"curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1\" ] You don't include the double quotes and brackets when you use the Amazon Web Services Management Console. CMD-SHELL, curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1 An exit code of 0 indicates success, and non-zero exit code indicates failure. For more information, see HealthCheck in the docker container create command. (string) --- interval (integer) --- The time period in seconds between each health check execution. You may specify between 5 and 300 seconds. The default value is 30 seconds. This value applies only when you specify a command. timeout (integer) --- The time period in seconds to wait for a health check to succeed before it is considered a failure. You may specify between 2 and 60 seconds. The default value is 5. retries (integer) --- The number of times to retry a failed health check before the container is considered unhealthy. You may specify between 1 and 10 retries. The default value is 3. startPeriod (integer) --- The optional grace period to provide containers time to bootstrap before failed health checks count towards the maximum number of retries. You can specify between 0 and 300 seconds. By default, the startPeriod is off. systemControls (list) --- A list of namespaced kernel parameters to set in the container. This parameter maps to Sysctls in the docker container create command and the --sysctl option to docker run. For example, you can configure net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time setting to maintain longer lived connections. (dict) --- A list of namespaced kernel parameters to set in the container. We don't recommend that you specify network-related systemControls parameters for multiple containers in a single task that also uses either the awsvpc or host network mode. Doing this has the following disadvantages: For tasks that use the awsvpc network mode including Fargate, if you set systemControls for any container, it applies to all containers in the task. If you set different systemControls for multiple containers in a single task, the container that's started last determines which systemControls take effect. For tasks that use the host network mode, the network namespace systemControls aren't supported. If you're setting an IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in the task, the following conditions apply to your system controls. For more information, see IPC mode. For tasks that use the host IPC mode, IPC namespace systemControls aren't supported. For tasks that use the task IPC mode, IPC namespace systemControls values apply to all containers within a task. namespace (string) --- The namespaced kernel parameter to set a value for. value (string) --- The namespaced kernel parameter to set a value for. Valid IPC namespace values: \"kernel.msgmax\" | \"kernel.msgmnb\" | \"kernel.msgmni\" | \"kernel.sem\" | \"kernel.shmall\" | \"kernel.shmmax\" | \"kernel.shmmni\" | \"kernel.shm_rmid_forced\", and Sysctls that start with \"fs.mqueue.*\" Valid network namespace values: Sysctls that start with \"net.*\" All of these values are supported by Fargate. resourceRequirements (list) --- The type and amount of a resource to assign to a container. The only supported resource is a GPU. (dict) --- The type and amount of a resource to assign to a container. The supported resource types are GPUs and Elastic Inference accelerators. For more information, see Working with GPUs on Amazon ECS or Working with Amazon Elastic Inference on Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide The value for the specified resource type. When the type is GPU, the value is the number of physical GPUs the Amazon ECS container agent reserves for the container. The number of GPUs that's reserved for all containers in a task can't exceed the number of available GPUs on the container instance that the task is launched on. When the type is InferenceAccelerator, the value matches the deviceName for an InferenceAccelerator specified in a task definition. The type of resource to assign to a container. firelensConfiguration (dict) --- The FireLens configuration for the container. This is used to specify and configure a log router for container logs. For more information, see Custom Log Routing in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. The log router to use. The valid values are fluentd or fluentbit. options (dict) --- The options to use when configuring the log router. This field is optional and can be used to specify a custom configuration file or to add additional metadata, such as the task, task definition, cluster, and container instance details to the log event. If specified, the syntax to use is \"options\":{\"enable-ecs-log-metadata\":\"true|false\",\"config-file-type:\"s3|file\",\"config-file-value\":\"arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/fluent.conf|filepath\"}. For more information, see Creating a task definition that uses a FireLens configuration in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. (string) --- (string) --- credentialSpecs (list) --- A list of ARNs in SSM or Amazon S3 to a credential spec ( CredSpec) file that configures the container for Active Directory authentication. We recommend that you use this parameter instead of the dockerSecurityOptions. The maximum number of ARNs is 1. There are two formats for each ARN. credentialspecdomainless:MyARN You use credentialspecdomainless:MyARN to provide a CredSpec with an additional section for a secret in Secrets Manager. You provide the login credentials to the domain in the secret. Each task that runs on any container instance can join different domains. You can use this format without joining the container instance to a domain. credentialspec:MyARN You use credentialspec:MyARN to provide a CredSpec for a single domain. You must join the container instance to the domain before you start any tasks that use this task definition. In both formats, replace MyARN with the ARN in SSM or Amazon S3. If you provide a credentialspecdomainless:MyARN, the credspec must provide a ARN in Secrets Manager for a secret containing the username, password, and the domain to connect to. For better security, the instance isn't joined to the domain for domainless authentication. Other applications on the instance can't use the domainless credentials. You can use this parameter to run tasks on the same instance, even it the tasks need to join different domains.

This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and the only requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task be lower than the task-level cpu value. Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that's the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task is guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed. Moreover, each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it. If both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units. On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers.

Some of the options you can specify when you use the awslogs log driver to route logs to Amazon CloudWatch include the following: Required: No Specify whether you want the log group to be created automatically. If this option isn't specified, it defaults to false. Required: Yes Specify the Amazon Web Services Region that the awslogs log driver is to send your Docker logs to. You can choose to send all of your logs from clusters in different Regions to a single region in CloudWatch Logs. This is so that they're all visible in one location. Otherwise, you can separate them by Region for more granularity. Make sure that the specified log group exists in the Region that you specify with this option. Required: Yes Make sure to specify a log group that the awslogs log driver sends its log streams to. Required: Yes, when using Fargate.Optional when using EC2. Use the awslogs-stream-prefix option to associate a log stream with the specified prefix, the container name, and the ID of the Amazon ECS task that the container belongs to. If you specify a prefix with this option, then the log stream takes the format prefix-name/container-name/ecs-task-id. If you don't specify a prefix with this option, then the log stream is named after the container ID that's assigned by the Docker daemon on the container instance. Because it's difficult to trace logs back to the container that sent them with just the Docker container ID (which is only available on the container instance), we recommend that you specify a prefix with this option. For Amazon ECS services, you can use the service name as the prefix. Doing so, you can trace log streams to the service that the container belongs to, the name of the container that sent them, and the ID of the task that the container belongs to. You must specify a stream-prefix for your logs to have your logs appear in the Log pane when using the Amazon ECS console. Required: No This option defines a multiline start pattern in Python strftime format. A log message consists of a line that matches the pattern and any following lines that don't match the pattern. The matched line is the delimiter between log messages. One example of a use case for using this format is for parsing output such as a stack dump, which might otherwise be logged in multiple entries. The correct pattern allows it to be captured in a single entry. For more information, see awslogs-datetime-format. You cannot configure both the awslogs-datetime-format and awslogs-multiline-pattern options. Required: No This option defines a multiline start pattern that uses a regular expression. For more information, see awslogs-multiline-pattern. This option is ignored if awslogs-datetime-format is also configured. The following options apply to all supported log drivers. Required: No Valid values: non-blocking | blocking This option defines the delivery mode of log messages from the container to the log driver specified using logDriver. The delivery mode you choose affects application availability when the flow of logs from container is interrupted. If you use the blocking mode and the flow of logs is interrupted, calls from container code to write to the stdout and stderr streams will block. The logging thread of the application will block as a result. This may cause the application to become unresponsive and lead to container healthcheck failure. If you use the non-blocking mode, the container's logs are instead stored in an in-memory intermediate buffer configured with the max-buffer-size option. This prevents the application from becoming unresponsive when logs cannot be sent. We recommend using this mode if you want to ensure service availability and are okay with some log loss. For more information, see Preventing log loss with non-blocking mode in the awslogs container log driver. You can set a default mode for all containers in a specific Amazon Web Services Region by using the defaultLogDriverMode account setting. If you don't specify the mode option or configure the account setting, Amazon ECS will default to the blocking mode. For more information about the account setting, see Default log driver mode in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Required: No Default value: 1m When non-blocking mode is used, the max-buffer-size log option controls the size of the buffer that's used for intermediate message storage. Make sure to specify an adequate buffer size based on your application. When the buffer fills up, further logs cannot be stored. Logs that cannot be stored are lost. To route logs using the splunk log router, you need to specify a splunk-token and a splunk-url. When you use the awsfirelens log router to route logs to an Amazon Web Services Service or Amazon Web Services Partner Network destination for log storage and analytics, you can set the log-driver-buffer-limit option to limit the number of events that are buffered in memory, before being sent to the log router container. It can help to resolve potential log loss issue because high throughput might result in memory running out for the buffer inside of Docker. Other options you can specify when using awsfirelens to route logs depend on the destination. When you export logs to Amazon Data Firehose, you can specify the Amazon Web Services Region with region and a name for the log stream with delivery_stream. When you export logs to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, you can specify an Amazon Web Services Region with region and a data stream name with stream. When you export logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service, you can specify options like Name, Host (OpenSearch Service endpoint without protocol), Port, Index, Type, Aws_auth, Aws_region, Suppress_Type_Name, and tls. For more information, see Under the hood: FireLens for Amazon ECS Tasks. When you export logs to Amazon S3, you can specify the bucket using the bucket option. You can also specify region, total_file_size, upload_timeout, and use_put_object as options. This parameter requires version 1.19 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance.

      "description": "A list of volume definitions in JSON format that containers in your task might use. (dict) --- The data volume configuration for tasks launched using this task definition. Specifying a volume configuration in a task definition is optional. The volume configuration may contain multiple volumes but only one volume configured at launch is supported. Each volume defined in the volume configuration may only specify a name and one of either configuredAtLaunch, dockerVolumeConfiguration, efsVolumeConfiguration, fsxWindowsFileServerVolumeConfiguration, or host. If an empty volume configuration is specified, by default Amazon ECS uses a host volume. For more information, see Using data volumes in tasks. name (string) --- The name of the volume. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. When using a volume configured at launch, the name is required and must also be specified as the volume name in the ServiceVolumeConfiguration or TaskVolumeConfiguration parameter when creating your service or standalone task. For all other types of volumes, this name is referenced in the sourceVolume parameter of the mountPoints object in the container definition. When a volume is using the efsVolumeConfiguration, the name is required. host (dict) --- This parameter is specified when you use bind mount host volumes. The contents of the host parameter determine whether your bind mount host volume persists on the host container instance and where it's stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to persist after the containers that are associated with it stop running. Windows containers can mount whole directories on the same drive as $env:ProgramData. Windows containers can't mount directories on a different drive, and mount point can't be across drives. For example, you can mount C:\\my\\path:C:\\my\\path and D:\\:D:\\, but not D:\\my\\path:C:\\my\\path or D:\\:C:\\my\\path. sourcePath (string) --- When the host parameter is used, specify a sourcePath to declare the path on the host container instance that's presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If the host parameter contains a sourcePath file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the sourcePath value doesn't exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported. If you're using the Fargate launch type, the sourcePath parameter is not supported. dockerVolumeConfiguration (dict) --- This parameter is specified when you use Docker volumes. Windows containers only support the use of the local driver. To use bind mounts, specify the host parameter instead. scope (string) --- The scope for the Docker volume that determines its lifecycle. Docker volumes that are scoped to a task are automatically provisioned when the task starts and destroyed when the task stops. Docker volumes that are scoped as shared persist after the task stops. autoprovision (boolean) --- If this value is true, the Docker volume is created if it doesn't already exist. driver (string) --- The Docker volume driver to use. The driver value must match the driver name provided by Docker because it is used for task placement. If the driver was installed using the Docker plugin CLI, use docker plugin ls to retrieve the driver name from your container instance. If the driver was installed using another method, use Docker plugin discovery to retrieve the driver name. This parameter maps to Driver in the docker container create command and the xxdriver option to docker volume create. driverOpts (dict) --- A map of Docker driver-specific options passed through. This parameter maps to DriverOpts in the docker create-volume command and the xxopt option to docker volume create. (string) --- (string) --- labels (dict) --- Custom metadata to add to your Docker volume. This parameter maps to Labels in the docker container create command and the xxlabel option to docker volume create. (string) --- (string) --- efsVolumeConfiguration (dict) --- This parameter is specified when you use an Amazon Elastic File System file system for task storage. The Amazon EFS file system ID to use. rootDirectory (string) --- The directory within the Amazon EFS file system to mount as the root directory inside the host. If this parameter is omitted, the root of the Amazon EFS volume will be used. Specifying / will have the same effect as omitting this parameter. transitEncryption (string) --- Determines whether to use encryption for Amazon EFS data in transit between the Amazon ECS host and the Amazon EFS server. Transit encryption must be turned on if Amazon EFS IAM authorization is used. If this parameter is omitted, the default value of DISABLED is used. For more information, see Encrypting data in transit in the Amazon Elastic File System User Guide. transitEncryptionPort (integer) --- The port to use when sending encrypted data between the Amazon ECS host and the Amazon EFS server. If you do not specify a transit encryption port, it will use the port selection strategy that the Amazon EFS mount helper uses. For more information, see EFS mount helper in the Amazon Elastic File System User Guide. authorizationConfig (dict) --- The authorization configuration details for the Amazon EFS file system. accessPointId (string) --- The Amazon EFS access point ID to use. If an access point is specified, the root directory value specified in the EFSVolumeConfiguration must either be omitted or set to / which will enforce the path set on the EFS access point. If an access point is used, transit encryption must be on in the EFSVolumeConfiguration. For more information, see Working with Amazon EFS access points in the Amazon Elastic File System User Guide. iam (string) --- Determines whether to use the Amazon ECS task role defined in a task definition when mounting the Amazon EFS file system. If it is turned on, transit encryption must be turned on in the EFSVolumeConfiguration. For more information, see Using Amazon EFS access points in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. fsxWindowsFileServerVolumeConfiguration (dict) --- This parameter is specified when you use Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system for task storage. The Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system ID to use. The directory within the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system to mount as the root directory inside the host. The authorization configuration details for the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. The authorization credential option to use. The authorization credential options can be provided using either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Secrets Manager secret or SSM Parameter Store parameter. The ARN refers to the stored credentials. A fully qualified domain name hosted by an Directory Service Managed Microsoft AD (Active Directory) or self-hosted AD on Amazon EC2. configuredAtLaunch (boolean) --- Indicates whether the volume should be configured at launch time. This is used to create Amazon EBS volumes for standalone tasks or tasks created as part of a service. Each task definition revision may only have one volume configured at launch in the volume configuration. To configure a volume at launch time, use this task definition revision and specify a volumeConfigurations object when calling the CreateService, UpdateService, RunTask or StartTask APIs.",
