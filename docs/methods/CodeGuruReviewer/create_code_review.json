BranchDiff (dict) --- A type of SourceCodeType that specifies a source branch name and a destination branch name in an associated repository. The source branch for a diff in an associated repository. The destination branch for a diff in an associated repository. S3BucketRepository (dict) --- Information about an associated repository in an S3 bucket that includes its name and an S3RepositoryDetails object. The S3RepositoryDetails object includes the name of an S3 bucket, an S3 key for a source code .zip file, and an S3 key for a build artifacts .zip file. S3BucketRepository is required in SourceCodeType for S3BucketRepository based code reviews. The name of the repository when the ProviderType is S3Bucket. Details (dict) --- An S3RepositoryDetails object that specifies the name of an S3 bucket and a CodeArtifacts object.

RequestId (string) --- The ID of the request. This is required for a pull request code review. Requester (string) --- An identifier, such as a name or account ID, that is associated with the requester. The Requester is used to capture the author/actor name of the event request. EventInfo (dict) --- Information about the event associated with a code review. Name (string) --- The name of the event. The possible names are pull_request, workflow_dispatch, schedule, and push State (string) --- The state of an event. The state might be open, closed, or another state. VendorName (string) --- The name of the repository vendor used to upload code to an S3 bucket for a CI/CD code review. For example, if code and artifacts are uploaded to an S3 bucket for a CI/CD code review by GitHub scripts from a GitHub repository, then the repository association's ProviderType is S3Bucket and the CI/CD repository vendor name is GitHub.
