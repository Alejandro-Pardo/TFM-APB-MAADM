  "description": "Deletes a CloudWatch Logs account policy. This stops the account-wide policy from applying to log groups in the account. If you delete a data protection policy or subscription filter policy, any log-group level policies of those types remain in effect. To use this operation, you must be signed on with the correct permissions depending on the type of policy that you are deleting. If you delete a field index policy, the indexing of the log events that happened before you deleted the policy will still be used for up to 30 days to improve CloudWatch Logs Insights queries.",
