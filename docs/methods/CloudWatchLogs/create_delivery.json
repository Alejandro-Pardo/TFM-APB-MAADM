  "description": "Creates a delivery. A delivery is a connection between a logical delivery source and a logical delivery destination that you have already created. Only some Amazon Web Services services support being configured as a delivery source using this operation. These services are listed as Supported [V2 Permissions] in the table at Enabling logging from Amazon Web Services services. A delivery destination can represent a log group in CloudWatch Logs, an Amazon S3 bucket, or a delivery stream in Firehose. To configure logs delivery between a supported Amazon Web Services service and a destination, you must do the following: You can configure a single delivery source to send logs to multiple destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create multiple deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs to the same delivery destination. To update an existing delivery configuration, use UpdateDeliveryConfiguration.",
