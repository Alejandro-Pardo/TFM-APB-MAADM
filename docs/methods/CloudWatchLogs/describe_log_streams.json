You can specify the log group to search by using either logGroupIdentifier or logGroupName. You must include one of these two parameters, but you can't include both. This operation has a limit of 25 transactions per second, after which transactions are throttled. If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account and view data from the linked source accounts.
