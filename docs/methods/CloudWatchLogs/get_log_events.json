  "description": "Lists log events from the specified log stream. You can list all of the log events or filter using a time range. GetLogEvents is a paginated operation. Each page returned can contain up to 1 MB of log events or up to 10,000 log events. A returned page might only be partially full, or even empty. For example, if the result of a query would return 15,000 log events, the first page isn't guaranteed to have 10,000 log events even if they all fit into 1 MB. Partially full or empty pages don't necessarily mean that pagination is finished. As long as the nextBackwardToken or nextForwardToken returned is NOT equal to the nextToken that you passed into the API call, there might be more log events available. The token that you use depends on the direction you want to move in along the log stream. The returned tokens are never null. If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account and view data from the linked source accounts. For more information, see CloudWatch cross-account observability. You can specify the log group to search by using either logGroupIdentifier or logGroupName. You must include one of these two parameters, but you can't include both.",
