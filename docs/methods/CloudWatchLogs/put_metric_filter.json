  "description": "Creates or updates a metric filter and associates it with the specified log group. With metric filters, you can configure rules to extract metric data from log events ingested through PutLogEvents. The maximum number of metric filters that can be associated with a log group is 100. Using regular expressions in filter patterns is supported. For these filters, there is a quota of two regular expression patterns within a single filter pattern. There is also a quota of five regular expression patterns per log group. For more information about using regular expressions in filter patterns, see Filter pattern syntax for metric filters, subscription filters, filter log events, and Live Tail. When you create a metric filter, you can also optionally assign a unit and dimensions to the metric that is created.",
