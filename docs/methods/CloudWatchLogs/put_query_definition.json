  "description": "Creates or updates a query definition for CloudWatch Logs Insights. For more information, see Analyzing Log Data with CloudWatch Logs Insights. To update a query definition, specify its queryDefinitionId in your request. The values of name, queryString, and logGroupNames are changed to the values that you specify in your update operation. No current values are retained from the current query definition. For example, imagine updating a current query definition that includes log groups. If you don't specify the logGroupNames parameter in your update operation, the query definition changes to contain no log groups. You must have the logs:PutQueryDefinition permission to be able to perform this operation.",
