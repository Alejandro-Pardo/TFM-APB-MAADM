  "description": "Creates an integration between CloudWatch Logs and another service in this account. Currently, only integrations with OpenSearch Service are supported, and currently you can have only one integration in your account. Integrating with OpenSearch Service makes it possible for you to create curated vended logs dashboards, powered by OpenSearch Service analytics. For more information, see Vended log dashboards powered by Amazon OpenSearch Service. You can use this operation only to create a new integration. You can't modify an existing integration.",
