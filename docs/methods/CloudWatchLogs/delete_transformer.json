  "description": "Deletes the log transformer for the specified log group. As soon as you do this, the transformation of incoming log events according to that transformer stops. If this account has an account-level transformer that applies to this log group, the log group begins using that account-level transformer when this log-group level transformer is deleted. After you delete a transformer, be sure to edit any metric filters or subscription filters that relied on the transformed versions of the log events.",
