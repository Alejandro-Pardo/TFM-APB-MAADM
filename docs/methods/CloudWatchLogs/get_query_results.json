  "description": "Returns the results from the specified query. Only the fields requested in the query are returned, along with a @ptr field, which is the identifier for the log record. You can use the value of @ptr in a GetLogRecord operation to get the full log record. GetQueryResults does not start running a query. To run a query, use StartQuery. For more information about how long results of previous queries are available, see CloudWatch Logs quotas. If the value of the Status field in the output is Running, this operation returns only partial results. If you see a value of Scheduled or Running for the status, you can retry the operation later to see the final results. If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account to start queries in linked source accounts. For more information, see CloudWatch cross-account observability.",
