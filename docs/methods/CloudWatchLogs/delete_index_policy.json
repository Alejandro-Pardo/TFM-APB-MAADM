  "description": "Deletes a log-group level field index policy that was applied to a single log group. The indexing of the log events that happened before you delete the policy will still be used for as many as 30 days to improve CloudWatch Logs Insights queries. You can't use this operation to delete an account-level index policy. Instead, use DeletAccountPolicy. If you delete a log-group level field index policy and there is an account-level field index policy, in a few minutes the log group begins using that account-wide policy to index new incoming log events.",
