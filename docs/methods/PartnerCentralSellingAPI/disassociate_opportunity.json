This operation is the counterpart to AssociateOpportunity, and it provides flexibility to manage associations as business needs change. Use this operation to update the associations of an Opportunity due to changes in the related entities, or if an association was made in error. Ensuring accurate associations helps maintain clarity and accuracy to track and manage business opportunities.
