  "description": "Registers instances that were created outside of OpsWorks Stacks with a specified stack. Registered instances have the same requirements as instances that are created by using the  CreateInstance API. For example, registered instances must be running a supported Linux-based operating system, and they must have a supported instance type. For more information about requirements for instances that you want to register, see Preparing the Instance. Required Permissions: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more information on user permissions, see Managing User Permissions.",
