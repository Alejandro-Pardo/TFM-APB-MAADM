DatetimeFormat (string) --- Specifies how the time stamp is extracted from logs. For more information, see the CloudWatch Logs Agent Reference. TimeZone (string) --- Specifies the time zone of log event time stamps. File (string) --- Specifies log files that you want to push to CloudWatch Logs. File can point to a specific file or multiple files (by using wild card characters such as /var/log/system.log*). Only the latest file is pushed to CloudWatch Logs, based on file modification time.

The default value is --\u00981', meaning the first line is used to calculate the fingerprint. Fingerprint lines are not sent to CloudWatch Logs unless all specified lines are available. MultiLineStartPattern (string) --- Specifies the pattern for identifying the start of a log message. InitialPosition (string) --- Specifies where to start to read data (start_of_file or end_of_file). The default is start_of_file. This setting is only used if there is no state persisted for that log stream. Encoding (string) --- Specifies the encoding of the log file so that the file can be read correctly. The default is utf_8. Encodings supported by Python codecs.decode() can be used here. BufferDuration (integer) --- Specifies the time duration for the batching of log events. The minimum value is 5000ms and default value is 5000ms. BatchCount (integer) --- Specifies the max number of log events in a batch, up to 10000. The default value is 1000. BatchSize (integer) --- Specifies the maximum size of log events in a batch, in bytes, up to 1048576 bytes. The default value is 32768 bytes.
