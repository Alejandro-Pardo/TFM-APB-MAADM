If the load exceeds these thresholds for a specified amount of time, OpsWorks Stacks starts a specified number of instances.

IgnoreMetricsTime (integer) --- The amount of time (in minutes) after a scaling event occurs that OpsWorks Stacks should ignore metrics and suppress additional scaling events. For example, OpsWorks Stacks adds new instances following an upscaling event but the instances won't start reducing the load until they have been booted and configured. There is no point in raising additional scaling events during that operation, which typically takes several minutes. IgnoreMetricsTime allows you to direct OpsWorks Stacks to suppress scaling events long enough to get the new instances online.
