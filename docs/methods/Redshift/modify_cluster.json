  "description": "Modifies the settings for a cluster. You can also change node type and the number of nodes to scale up or down the cluster. When resizing a cluster, you must specify both the number of nodes and the node type even if one of the parameters does not change. You can add another security or parameter group, or change the admin user password. Resetting a cluster password or modifying the security groups associated with a cluster do not need a reboot. However, modifying a parameter group requires a reboot for parameters to take effect. For more information about managing clusters, go to Amazon Redshift Clusters in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide. VPC Block Public Access (BPA) enables you to block resources in VPCs and subnets that you own in a Region from reaching or being reached from the internet through internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways. If a subnet group for a provisioned cluster is in an account with VPC BPA turned on, the following capabilities are blocked: For more information about VPC BPA, see Block public access to VPCs and subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.",
