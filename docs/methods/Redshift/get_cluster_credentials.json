  "description": "Returns a database user name and temporary password with temporary authorization to log on to an Amazon Redshift database. The action returns the database user name prefixed with IAM: if AutoCreate is False or IAMA: if AutoCreate is True. You can optionally specify one or more database user groups that the user will join at log on. By default, the temporary credentials expire in 900 seconds. You can optionally specify a duration between 900 seconds (15 minutes) and 3600 seconds (60 minutes). For more information, see Using IAM Authentication to Generate Database User Credentials in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide. The Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role that runs GetClusterCredentials must have an IAM policy attached that allows access to all necessary actions and resources. For more information about permissions, see Resource Policies for GetClusterCredentials in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide. If the DbGroups parameter is specified, the IAM policy must allow the redshift:JoinGroup action with access to the listed dbgroups. In addition, if the AutoCreate parameter is set to True, then the policy must include the redshift:CreateClusterUser permission. If the DbName parameter is specified, the IAM policy must allow access to the resource dbname for the specified database name.",
