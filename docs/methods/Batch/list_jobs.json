The filter doesn't apply to child jobs in an array or multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. The results are sorted by the createdAt field, with the most recent jobs being first. JOB_NAME The value of the filter is a case-insensitive match for the job name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter matches any job name that begins with the string before the --\u0098*'. This corresponds to the jobName value. For example, test1 matches both Test1 and test1, and test1* matches both test1 and Test10. When the JOB_NAME filter is used, the results are grouped by the job name and version. JOB_DEFINITION The value for the filter is the name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job definition. This corresponds to the jobDefinition value. The value is case sensitive. When the value for the filter is the job definition name, the results include all the jobs that used any revision of that job definition name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter matches any job definition name that begins with the string before the --\u0098*'. For example, jd1 matches only jd1, and jd1* matches both jd1 and jd1A. The version of the job definition that's used doesn't affect the sort order. When the JOB_DEFINITION filter is used and the ARN is used (which is in the form arn:${Partition}:batch:${Region}:${Account}:job-definition/${JobDefinitionName}:${Revision}), the results include jobs that used the specified revision of the job definition. Asterisk (*) isn't supported when the ARN is used. BEFORE_CREATED_AT The value for the filter is the time that's before the job was created. This corresponds to the createdAt value. The value is a string representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970. AFTER_CREATED_AT The value for the filter is the time that's after the job was created.
