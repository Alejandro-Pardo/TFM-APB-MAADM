  "description": "Creates an Batch compute environment. You can create MANAGED or UNMANAGED compute environments. MANAGED compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or Fargate resources. UNMANAGED compute environments can only use EC2 resources. In a managed compute environment, Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the launch template that you specify when you create the compute environment. Either, you can choose to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot Instances. Or, you can use Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a specified percentage of the On-Demand price. In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute resources and have flexibility with how you configure your compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMIs. However, you must verify that each of your AMIs meet the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see container instance AMIs in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. After you created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the  DescribeComputeEnvironments operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that's associated with it. Then, launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see Launching an Amazon ECS container instance in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.",

If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand. If the state is DISABLED, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a STARTING or RUNNING state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the DISABLED state don't scale out. When an instance is idle, the instance scales down to the minvCpus value. However, the instance size doesn't change.

      "description": "Details about the compute resources managed by the compute environment. This parameter is required for managed compute environments. For more information, see Compute Environments in the Batch User Guide. The type of compute environment: EC2, SPOT, FARGATE, or FARGATE_SPOT. For more information, see Compute environments in the Batch User Guide. If you choose SPOT, you must also specify an Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role with the spotIamFleetRole parameter. For more information, see Amazon EC2 spot fleet role in the Batch User Guide. allocationStrategy (string) --- The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource if not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This might be because of availability of the instance type in the Region or Amazon EC2 service limits. For more information, see Allocation strategies in the Batch User Guide. Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If additional instances of the selected instance type aren't available, Batch waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren't enough instances available or the user is reaching Amazon EC2 service limits, additional jobs aren't run until the currently running jobs are completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you're using Spot Fleets with BEST_FIT, the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified. Compute resources that use a BEST_FIT allocation strategy don't support infrastructure updates and can't update some parameters. For more information, see Updating compute environments in the Batch User Guide. BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE Batch selects additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue. Its preference is for instance types with lower cost vCPUs. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren't available, Batch selects new instance types. SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED Batch selects one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue. Its preference is for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources. SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED The price and capacity optimized allocation strategy looks at both price and capacity to select the Spot Instance pools that are the least likely to be interrupted and have the lowest possible price. With BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE, SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED and SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED (recommended) strategies using On-Demand or Spot Instances, and the BEST_FIT strategy using Spot Instances, Batch might need to exceed maxvCpus to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Batch never exceeds maxvCpus by more than a single instance. minvCpus (integer) --- The minimum number of vCPUs that a compute environment should maintain (even if the compute environment is DISABLED). The maximum number of vCPUs that a compute environment can support. desiredvCpus (integer) --- The desired number of vCPUS in the compute environment. Batch modifies this value between the minimum and maximum values based on job queue demand. instanceTypes (list) --- The instances types that can be launched. You can specify instance families to launch any instance type within those families (for example, c5 or p3), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such as c5.8xlarge). You can also choose optimal to select instance types (from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families) that match the demand of your job queues. (string) --- imageId (string) --- The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used for instances launched in the compute environment. This parameter is overridden by the imageIdOverride member of the Ec2Configuration structure. The VPC subnets where the compute resources are launched. These subnets must be within the same VPC. Fargate compute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. For more information, see VPCs and subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide. (string) --- securityGroupIds (list) --- The Amazon EC2 security groups that are associated with instances launched in the compute environment. One or more security groups must be specified, either in securityGroupIds or using a launch template referenced in launchTemplate. This parameter is required for jobs that are running on Fargate resources and must contain at least one security group. Fargate doesn't support launch templates. If security groups are specified using both securityGroupIds and launchTemplate, the values in securityGroupIds are used. (string) --- ec2KeyPair (string) --- The Amazon EC2 key pair that's used for instances launched in the compute environment. You can use this key pair to log in to your instances with SSH. instanceRole (string) --- The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. This parameter is required for Amazon EC2 instances types. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, ecsInstanceRole or ``arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:instance-profile/ecsInstanceRole ``. For more information, see Amazon ECS instance role in the Batch User Guide. tags (dict) --- Key-value pair tags to be applied to Amazon EC2 resources that are launched in the compute environment. For Batch, these take the form of \"String1\": \"String2\", where String1 is the tag key and String2 is the tag value (for example, { \"Name\": \"Batch Instance - C4OnDemand\" }). This is helpful for recognizing your Batch instances in the Amazon EC2 console. Updating these tags requires an infrastructure update to the compute environment. These tags aren't seen when using the Batch ListTagsForResource API operation. (string) --- (string) --- placementGroup (string) --- The Amazon EC2 placement group to associate with your compute resources. If you intend to submit multi-node parallel jobs to your compute environment, you should consider creating a cluster placement group and associate it with your compute resources. This keeps your multi-node parallel job on a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone with high network flow potential. For more information, see Placement groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. bidPercentage (integer) --- The maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot price must be less than 20% of the current On-Demand price for that Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you leave this field empty, the default value is 100% of the On-Demand price. For most use cases, we recommend leaving this field empty. spotIamFleetRole (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet IAM role applied to a SPOT compute environment. This role is required if the allocation strategy set to BEST_FIT or if the allocation strategy isn't specified. launchTemplate (dict) --- The launch template to use for your compute resources. Any other compute resource parameters that you specify in a CreateComputeEnvironment API operation override the same parameters in the launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request, but not both. For more information, see Launch template support in the Batch User Guide. launchTemplateId (string) --- The ID of the launch template. launchTemplateName (string) --- The name of the launch template. version (string) --- The version number of the launch template, $Default, or $Latest. If the value is $Default, the default version of the launch template is used. If the value is $Latest, the latest version of the launch template is used. Default: $Default Latest: $Latest overrides (list) --- A launch template to use in place of the default launch template. You can specify up to ten (10) launch template overrides that are associated to unique instance types or families for each compute environment. (dict) --- An object that represents a launch template to use in place of the default launch template. If security groups are specified using both the securityGroupIds parameter of CreateComputeEnvironment and the launch template, the values in the securityGroupIds parameter of CreateComputeEnvironment will be used. You can define up to ten (10) overrides for each compute environment. Note: If you specify the launchTemplateId you can't specify the launchTemplateName as well. Note: If you specify the launchTemplateName you can't specify the launchTemplateId as well. Default: $Default Latest: $Latest targetInstanceTypes (list) --- The instance type or family that this override launch template should be applied to. This parameter is required when defining a launch template override. Information included in this parameter must meet the following requirements: Must be a valid Amazon EC2 instance type or family. optimal isn't allowed. targetInstanceTypes can target only instance types and families that are included within the ComputeResource.instanceTypes set. targetInstanceTypes doesn't need to include all of the instances from the instanceType set, but at least a subset. For example, if ComputeResource.instanceTypes includes [m5, g5], targetInstanceTypes can include [m5.2xlarge] and [m5.large] but not [c5.large]. targetInstanceTypes included within the same launch template override or across launch template overrides can't overlap for the same compute environment. For example, you can't define one launch template override to target an instance family and another define an instance type within this same family. (string) --- ec2Configuration (list) --- Provides information that's used to select Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for Amazon EC2 instances in the compute environment. If Ec2Configuration isn't specified, the default is ECS_AL2. One or two values can be provided. (dict) --- Provides information used to select Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for instances in the compute environment. If Ec2Configuration isn't specified, the default is ECS_AL2 ( Amazon Linux 2). The image type to match with the instance type to select an AMI. The supported values are different for ECS and EKS resources. ECS If the imageIdOverride parameter isn't specified, then a recent Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI ( ECS_AL2) is used. If a new image type is specified in an update, but neither an imageId nor a imageIdOverride parameter is specified, then the latest Amazon ECS optimized AMI for that image type that's supported by Batch is used. ECS_AL2 Amazon Linux 2: Default for all non-GPU instance families. ECS_AL2_NVIDIA Amazon Linux 2 (GPU): Default for all GPU instance families (for example P4 and G4) and can be used for all non Amazon Web Services Graviton-based instance types. ECS_AL2023 Amazon Linux 2023: Batch supports Amazon Linux 2023. Amazon Linux. Amazon Linux has reached the end-of-life of standard support. For more information, see Amazon Linux AMI. EKS If the imageIdOverride parameter isn't specified, then a recent Amazon EKS-optimized Amazon Linux AMI ( EKS_AL2) is used. If a new image type is specified in an update, but neither an imageId nor a imageIdOverride parameter is specified, then the latest Amazon EKS optimized AMI for that image type that Batch supports is used. EKS_AL2 Amazon Linux 2: Default for all non-GPU instance families. EKS_AL2_NVIDIA Amazon Linux 2 (accelerated): Default for all GPU instance families (for example, P4 and G4) and can be used for all non Amazon Web Services Graviton-based instance types. imageIdOverride (string) --- The AMI ID used for instances launched in the compute environment that match the image type. This setting overrides the imageId set in the computeResource object. imageKubernetesVersion (string) --- The Kubernetes version for the compute environment. If you don't specify a value, the latest version that Batch supports is used.",
