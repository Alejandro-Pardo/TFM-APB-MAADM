  "description": "Deletes an Batch compute environment. Before you can delete a compute environment, you must set its state to DISABLED with the  UpdateComputeEnvironment API operation and disassociate it from any job queues with the  UpdateJobQueue API operation. Compute environments that use Fargate resources must terminate all active jobs on that compute environment before deleting the compute environment. If this isn't done, the compute environment enters an invalid state.",
