The identifier for the geofence to be stored in a given geofence collection. Contains the details to specify the position of the geofence. Can be a polygon, a circle or a polygon encoded in Geobuf format. Including multiple selections will return a validation error. Polygon (list) --- A polygon is a list of linear rings which are each made up of a list of vertices. Each vertex is a 2-dimensional point of the form: [longitude, latitude]. This is represented as an array of doubles of length 2 (so [double, double]). An array of 4 or more vertices, where the first and last vertex are the same (to form a closed boundary), is called a linear ring. The linear ring vertices must be listed in counter-clockwise order around the ring's interior. The linear ring is represented as an array of vertices, or an array of arrays of doubles ( [[double, double], ...]). A geofence consists of a single linear ring. To allow for future expansion, the Polygon parameter takes an array of linear rings, which is represented as an array of arrays of arrays of doubles ( [[[double, double], ...], ...]). A linear ring for use in geofences can consist of between 4 and 1,000 vertices. (list) --- (list) --- (float) --- Circle (dict) --- A circle on the earth, as defined by a center point and a radius. A single point geometry, specifying the center of the circle, using WGS 84 coordinates, in the form [longitude, latitude]. (float) --- The radius of the circle in meters. Must be greater than zero and no larger than 100,000 (100 kilometers). Geobuf (bytes) --- Geobuf is a compact binary encoding for geographic data that provides lossless compression of GeoJSON polygons. The Geobuf must be Base64-encoded. A polygon in Geobuf format can have up to 100,000 vertices. GeofenceProperties (dict) --- Associates one of more properties with the geofence. A property is a key-value pair stored with the geofence and added to any geofence event triggered with that geofence. Format: \"key\" : \"value\" (string) --- (string) ---",
