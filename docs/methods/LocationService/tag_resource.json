  "description": "Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified Amazon Location Service resource. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. You can use the TagResource operation with an Amazon Location Service resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the tags already associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that's already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. You can associate up to 50 tags with a resource.",
