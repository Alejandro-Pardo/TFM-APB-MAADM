The following are valid values for the actions. geo:GetMap* - Allows all actions needed for map rendering. geo:SearchPlaceIndexForText - Allows geocoding. geo:SearchPlaceIndexForPosition - Allows reverse geocoding. geo:SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions - Allows generating suggestions from text. GetPlace - Allows finding a place by place ID. geo:CalculateRoute - Allows point to point routing. geo:CalculateRouteMatrix - Allows calculating a matrix of routes. (string) --- A list of allowed resource ARNs that a API key bearer can perform actions on. The ARN must be the correct ARN for a map, place, or route ARN. You may include wildcards in the resource-id to match multiple resources of the same type. The resources must be in the same partition, region, and account-id as the key that is being created. Other than wildcards, you must include the full ARN, including the arn, partition, service, region, account-id and resource-id delimited by colons (:). No spaces allowed, even with wildcards. For example, arn:aws:geo:region:account-id:map/ExampleMap*. For more information about ARN format, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). (string) --- AllowReferers (list) --- An optional list of allowed HTTP referers for which requests must originate from. Requests using this API key from other domains will not be allowed.
