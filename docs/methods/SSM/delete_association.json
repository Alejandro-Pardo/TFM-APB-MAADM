If you created the association by using the Targets parameter, then you must delete the association by using the association ID. When you disassociate a document from a managed node, it doesn't change the configuration of the node. To change the configuration state of a managed node after you disassociate a document, you must create a new document with the desired configuration and associate it with the node.",
