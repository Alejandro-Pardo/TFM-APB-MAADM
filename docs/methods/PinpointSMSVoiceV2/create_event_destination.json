  "description": "Creates a new event destination in a configuration set. An event destination is a location where you send message events. The event options are Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Data Firehose, or Amazon SNS. For example, when a message is delivered successfully, you can send information about that event to an event destination, or send notifications to endpoints that are subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic. You can only create one event destination at a time. You must provide a value for a single event destination using either CloudWatchLogsDestination, KinesisFirehoseDestination or SnsDestination. If an event destination isn't provided then an exception is returned. Each configuration set can contain between 0 and 5 event destinations. Each event destination can contain a reference to a single destination, such as a CloudWatch or Firehose destination.",
