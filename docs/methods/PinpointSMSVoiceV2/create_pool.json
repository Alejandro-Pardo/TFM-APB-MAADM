A pool can include one or more phone numbers and SenderIds that are associated with your Amazon Web Services account. The new pool inherits its configuration from the specified origination identity. This includes keywords, message type, opt-out list, two-way configuration, and self-managed opt-out configuration. Deletion protection isn't inherited from the origination identity and defaults to false. If the origination identity is a phone number and is already associated with another pool, an error is returned. A sender ID can be associated with multiple pools.",
