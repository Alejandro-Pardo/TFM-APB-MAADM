      "description": "An object to describe the ports to close for the specified instance. fromPort (integer) --- The first port in a range of open ports on an instance. Allowed ports: TCP and UDP - 0 to 65535 ICMP - The ICMP type for IPv4 addresses. For example, specify 8 as the fromPort (ICMP type), and -1 as the toPort (ICMP code), to enable ICMP Ping. For more information, see Control Messages on Wikipedia. ICMPv6 - The ICMP type for IPv6 addresses. For example, specify 128 as the fromPort (ICMPv6 type), and 0 as toPort (ICMPv6 code). For more information, see Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6. toPort (integer) --- The last port in a range of open ports on an instance. Allowed ports: TCP and UDP - 0 to 65535 ICMP - The ICMP code for IPv4 addresses. ICMPv6 - The ICMP code for IPv6 addresses. protocol (string) --- The IP protocol name. The name can be one of the following: tcp - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of streamed data between applications running on hosts communicating by an IP network. If you have an application that doesn't require reliable data stream service, use UDP instead. all - All transport layer protocol types. For more general information, see Transport layer on Wikipedia. udp - With User Datagram Protocol (UDP), computer applications can send messages (or datagrams) to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Prior communications are not required to set up transmission channels or data paths. Applications that don't require reliable data stream service can use UDP, which provides a connectionless datagram service that emphasizes reduced latency over reliability. If you do require reliable data stream service, use TCP instead. icmp - Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to send error messages and operational information indicating success or failure when communicating with an instance. For example, an error is indicated when an instance could not be reached. When you specify icmp as the protocol, you must specify the ICMP type using the fromPort parameter, and ICMP code using the toPort parameter. icmp6 - Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) for IPv6. When you specify icmp6 as the protocol, you must specify the ICMP type using the fromPort parameter, and ICMP code using the toPort parameter. cidrs (list) --- The IPv4 address, or range of IPv4 addresses (in CIDR notation) that are allowed to connect to an instance through the ports, and the protocol. Examples: To allow the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify 192.0.2.44 or 192.0.2.44/32. To allow the IP addresses 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify 192.0.2.0/24. For more information about CIDR block notation, see Classless Inter-Domain Routing on Wikipedia. (string) --- ipv6Cidrs (list) --- The IPv6 address, or range of IPv6 addresses (in CIDR notation) that are allowed to connect to an instance through the ports, and the protocol. Only devices with an IPv6 address can connect to an instance through IPv6; otherwise, IPv4 should be used. (string) --- cidrListAliases (list) --- An alias that defines access for a preconfigured range of IP addresses. The only alias currently supported is lightsail-connect, which allows IP addresses of the browser-based RDP/SSH client in the Lightsail console to connect to your instance. (string) ---",
