Valid distribution metric names are listed below, along with the most useful statistics to include in your request, and the published unit value. Requests - The total number of viewer requests received by your Lightsail distribution, for all HTTP methods, and for both HTTP and HTTPS requests. Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum. Unit: The published unit is None. BytesDownloaded - The number of bytes downloaded by viewers for GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests. BytesUploaded - The number of bytes uploaded to your origin by your Lightsail distribution, using POST and PUT requests. TotalErrorRate - The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response's HTTP status code was 4xx or 5xx. Statistics: The most useful statistic is Average. Unit: The published unit is Percent. 4xxErrorRate - The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response's HTTP status cod was 4xx. In these cases, the client or client viewer may have made an error. For example, a status code of 404 (Not Found) means that the client requested an object that could not be found. 5xxErrorRate - The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response's HTTP status code was 5xx. In these cases, the origin server did not satisfy the requests. For example, a status code of 503 (Service Unavailable) means that the origin server is currently unavailable. Unit: The published unit is Percent.",

You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a metric. Average - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified period. By comparing this statistic with the Minimum and Maximum values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values.
