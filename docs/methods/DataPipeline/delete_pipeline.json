  "description": "Deletes a pipeline, its pipeline definition, and its run history. AWS Data Pipeline attempts to cancel instances associated with the pipeline that are currently being processed by task runners. Deleting a pipeline cannot be undone. You cannot query or restore a deleted pipeline. To temporarily pause a pipeline instead of deleting it, call  SetStatus with the status set to PAUSE on individual components. Components that are paused by  SetStatus can be resumed.",
