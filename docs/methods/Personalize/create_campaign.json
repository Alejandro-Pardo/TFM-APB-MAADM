  "description": "Creates a campaign that deploys a solution version. When a client calls the GetRecommendations and GetPersonalizedRanking APIs, a campaign is specified in the request. When you create an Amazon Personalize campaign, you can specify the minimum provisioned transactions per second ( minProvisionedTPS) for the campaign. This is the baseline transaction throughput for the campaign provisioned by Amazon Personalize. It sets the minimum billing charge for the campaign while it is active. A transaction is a single GetRecommendations or GetPersonalizedRanking request. The default minProvisionedTPS is 1. If your TPS increases beyond the minProvisionedTPS, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below minProvisionedTPS. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of transactions. When your traffic reduces, capacity returns to the minProvisionedTPS. You are charged for the the minimum provisioned TPS or, if your requests exceed the minProvisionedTPS, the actual TPS. The actual TPS is the total number of recommendation requests you make. We recommend starting with a low minProvisionedTPS, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the minProvisionedTPS as necessary. For more information about campaign costs, see Amazon Personalize pricing. A campaign can be in one of the following states: To get the campaign status, call DescribeCampaign.",
