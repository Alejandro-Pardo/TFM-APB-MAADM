When you update a solution, you can change whether the solution uses automatic training, and you can change the training frequency. For more information about updating a solution, see Updating a solution. A solution update can be in one of the following states: CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED. To get the status of a solution update, call the DescribeSolution API operation and find the status in the latestSolutionUpdate.",

If you manually create a solution version within the hour, the solution skips the first automatic training. For more information about automatic training, see Configuring automatic training.
