  "description": "Creates an empty dataset group. A dataset group is a container for Amazon Personalize resources. A dataset group can contain at most three datasets, one for each type of dataset: A dataset group can be a Domain dataset group, where you specify a domain and use pre-configured resources like recommenders, or a Custom dataset group, where you use custom resources, such as a solution with a solution version, that you deploy with a campaign. If you start with a Domain dataset group, you can still add custom resources such as solutions and solution versions trained with recipes for custom use cases and deployed with campaigns. A dataset group can be in one of the following states: To get the status of the dataset group, call DescribeDatasetGroup. If the status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a failureReason key, which describes why the creation failed. You can specify an Key Management Service (KMS) key to encrypt the datasets in the group. If you specify a KMS key, you must also include an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that has permission to access the key.",
