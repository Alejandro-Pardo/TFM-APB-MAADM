  "description": "Generates batch recommendations based on a list of items or users stored in Amazon S3 and exports the recommendations to an Amazon S3 bucket. To generate batch recommendations, specify the ARN of a solution version and an Amazon S3 URI for the input and output data. For user personalization, popular items, and personalized ranking solutions, the batch inference job generates a list of recommended items for each user ID in the input file. For related items solutions, the job generates a list of recommended items for each item ID in the input file. For more information, see Creating a batch inference job. If you use the Similar-Items recipe, Amazon Personalize can add descriptive themes to batch recommendations. To generate themes, set the job's mode to THEME_GENERATION and specify the name of the field that contains item names in the input data. For more information about generating themes, see Batch recommendations with themes from Content Generator. You can't get batch recommendations with the Trending-Now or Next-Best-Action recipes.",
