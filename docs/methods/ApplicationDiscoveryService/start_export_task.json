  "description": "Begins the export of a discovered data report to an Amazon S3 bucket managed by Amazon Web Services. If you do not specify preferences or agentIds in the filter, a summary of all servers, applications, tags, and performance is generated. This data is an aggregation of all server data collected through on-premises tooling, file import, application grouping and applying tags. If you specify agentIds in a filter, the task exports up to 72 hours of detailed data collected by the identified Application Discovery Agent, including network, process, and performance details. A time range for exported agent data may be set by using startTime and endTime. Export of detailed agent data is limited to five concurrently running exports. Export of detailed agent data is limited to two exports per day. If you enable ec2RecommendationsPreferences in preferences , an Amazon EC2 instance matching the characteristics of each server in Application Discovery Service is generated. Changing the attributes of the ec2RecommendationsPreferences changes the criteria of the recommendation.",
