  "description": "Creates a new recording configuration, used to enable recording to Amazon S3. Known issue: In the us-east-1 region, if you use the Amazon Web Services CLI to create a recording configuration, it returns success even if the S3 bucket is in a different region. In this case, the state of the recording configuration is CREATE_FAILED (instead of ACTIVE). (In other regions, the CLI correctly returns failure if the bucket is in a different region.) Workaround: Ensure that your S3 bucket is in the same region as the recording configuration. If you create a recording configuration in a different region as your S3 bucket, delete that recording configuration and create a new one with an S3 bucket from the correct region.",
