  "description": "Creates a service level objective (SLO), which can help you ensure that your critical business operations are meeting customer expectations. Use SLOs to set and track specific target levels for the reliability and availability of your applications and services. SLOs use service level indicators (SLIs) to calculate whether the application is performing at the level that you want. Create an SLO to set a target for a service or operation's availability or latency. CloudWatch measures this target frequently you can find whether it has been breached. The target performance quality that is defined for an SLO is the attainment goal. You can set SLO targets for your applications that are discovered by Application Signals, using critical metrics such as latency and availability. You can also set SLOs against any CloudWatch metric or math expression that produces a time series. When you create an SLO, you specify whether it is a period-based SLO or a request-based SLO. Each type of SLO has a different way of evaluating your application's performance against its attainment goal. After you have created an SLO, you can retrieve error budget reports for it. An error budget is the amount of time or amount of requests that your application can be non-compliant with the SLO's goal, and still have your application meet the goal. For more information about SLOs, see Service level objectives (SLOs). When you perform a CreateServiceLevelObjective operation, Application Signals creates the AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchApplicationSignals service-linked role, if it doesn't already exist in your account. This service- linked role has the following permissions:",

      "description": "If this SLO is a period-based SLO, this structure defines the information about what performance metric this SLO will monitor. You can't specify both RequestBasedSliConfig and SliConfig in the same operation. Use this structure to specify the metric to be used for the SLO. KeyAttributes (dict) --- If this SLO is related to a metric collected by Application Signals, you must use this field to specify which service the SLO metric is related to. To do so, you must specify at least the Type, Name, and Environment attributes. This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields. Type designates the type of object this is. ResourceType specifies the type of the resource. This field is used only when the value of the Type field is Resource or AWS::Resource. Name specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the value of the Type field is Service, RemoteService, or AWS::Service. Identifier identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is used only if the value of the Type field is Resource or AWS::Resource. Environment specifies the location where this object is hosted, or what it belongs to. (string) --- (string) --- OperationName (string) --- If the SLO is to monitor a specific operation of the service, use this field to specify the name of that operation. MetricType (string) --- If the SLO is to monitor either the LATENCY or AVAILABILITY metric that Application Signals collects, use this field to specify which of those metrics is used. Statistic (string) --- The statistic to use for comparison to the threshold. It can be any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic. For more information about statistics, see CloudWatch statistics definitions. PeriodSeconds (integer) --- The number of seconds to use as the period for SLO evaluation. Your application's performance is compared to the SLI during each period. For each period, the application is determined to have either achieved or not achieved the necessary performance. MetricDataQueries (list) --- If this SLO monitors a CloudWatch metric or the result of a CloudWatch metric math expression, use this structure to specify that metric or expression. (dict) --- Use this structure to define a metric or metric math expression that you want to use as for a service level objective. Each MetricDataQuery in the MetricDataQueries array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a metric math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single MetricDataQueries array can include as many as 20 MetricDataQuery structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a MetricStat parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the Expression parameter to perform a math expression. Of those Expression structures, exactly one must have true as the value for ReturnData. The result of this expression used for the SLO. For more information about metric math expressions, see CloudWatchUse metric math. Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either Expression or MetricStat but not both. A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This Id must be unique within a MetricDataQueries array. If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the metric math expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter. MetricStat (dict) --- A metric to be used directly for the SLO, or to be used in the math expression that will be used for the SLO. Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either Expression or MetricStat but not both. The metric to use as the service level indicator, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions. Namespace (string) --- The namespace of the metric. For more information, see Namespaces. MetricName (string) --- The name of the metric to use. Dimensions (list) --- An array of one or more dimensions to use to define the metric that you want to use. For more information, see Dimensions. (dict) --- A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish InstanceId as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension. You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric. The name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only ASCII characters, must include at least one non-whitespace character, and cannot start with a colon ( :). ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension names. The value of the dimension. Dimension values must contain only ASCII characters and must include at least one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension values. The granularity, in seconds, to be used for the metric. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a PutMetricData call that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second. The statistic to use for comparison to the threshold. Unit (string) --- If you omit Unit then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions. Expression (string) --- This field can contain a metric math expression to be performed on the other metrics that you are retrieving within this MetricDataQueries structure. A math expression can use the Id of the other metrics or queries to refer to those metrics, and can also use the Id of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see Metric Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. Label (string) --- A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default. You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see Using Dynamic Labels. ReturnData (boolean) --- Use this only if you are using a metric math expression for the SLO. Specify true for ReturnData for only the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same CreateServiceLevelObjective operation, specify ReturnData as false. Period (integer) --- The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points for this metric. If the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned: Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour). AccountId (string) --- The ID of the account where this metric is located. If you are performing this operation in a monitoring account, use this to specify which source account to retrieve this metric from. DependencyConfig (dict) --- Identifies the dependency using the DependencyKeyAttributes and DependencyOperationName. (string) --- (string) --- The name of the called operation in the dependency. This parameter is used only when a request-based SLO tracks the Latency metric. Specify the threshold value that the observed Latency metric values are to be compared to. The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified metric to the threshold.",

You can't specify both RequestBasedSliConfig and SliConfig in the same operation. Use this structure to specify the metric to be used for the SLO. KeyAttributes (dict) --- If this SLO is related to a metric collected by Application Signals, you must use this field to specify which service the SLO metric is related to. To do so, you must specify at least the Type, Name, and Environment attributes. This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields. Type designates the type of object this is. ResourceType specifies the type of the resource. This field is used only when the value of the Type field is Resource or AWS::Resource. Name specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the value of the Type field is Service, RemoteService, or AWS::Service. Identifier identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is used only if the value of the Type field is Resource or AWS::Resource. Environment specifies the location where this object is hosted, or what it belongs to. (string) --- (string) --- OperationName (string) --- If the SLO is to monitor a specific operation of the service, use this field to specify the name of that operation. MetricType (string) --- If the SLO is to monitor either the LATENCY or AVAILABILITY metric that Application Signals collects, use this field to specify which of those metrics is used. TotalRequestCountMetric (list) --- Use this structure to define the metric that you want to use as the 'total requests' number for a request-based SLO. This result will be divided by the 'good request' or 'bad request' value defined in MonitoredRequestCountMetric. (dict) --- Use this structure to define a metric or metric math expression that you want to use as for a service level objective. Each MetricDataQuery in the MetricDataQueries array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a metric math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single MetricDataQueries array can include as many as 20 MetricDataQuery structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a MetricStat parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the Expression parameter to perform a math expression. Of those Expression structures, exactly one must have true as the value for ReturnData. The result of this expression used for the SLO. For more information about metric math expressions, see CloudWatchUse metric math. Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either Expression or MetricStat but not both. A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This Id must be unique within a MetricDataQueries array. If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the metric math expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter. MetricStat (dict) --- A metric to be used directly for the SLO, or to be used in the math expression that will be used for the SLO. Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either Expression or MetricStat but not both. The metric to use as the service level indicator, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions. Namespace (string) --- The namespace of the metric. For more information, see Namespaces. MetricName (string) --- The name of the metric to use. Dimensions (list) --- An array of one or more dimensions to use to define the metric that you want to use. For more information, see Dimensions. (dict) --- A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish InstanceId as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension. You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric. The name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only ASCII characters, must include at least one non-whitespace character, and cannot start with a colon ( :). ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension names. The value of the dimension. Dimension values must contain only ASCII characters and must include at least one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension values. The granularity, in seconds, to be used for the metric. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a PutMetricData call that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second. The statistic to use for comparison to the threshold. It can be any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic. For more information about statistics, see CloudWatch statistics definitions. Unit (string) --- If you omit Unit then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions. Expression (string) --- This field can contain a metric math expression to be performed on the other metrics that you are retrieving within this MetricDataQueries structure. A math expression can use the Id of the other metrics or queries to refer to those metrics, and can also use the Id of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see Metric Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. Label (string) --- A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default. You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see Using Dynamic Labels. ReturnData (boolean) --- Use this only if you are using a metric math expression for the SLO. Specify true for ReturnData for only the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same CreateServiceLevelObjective operation, specify ReturnData as false. Period (integer) --- The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points for this metric. If the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned: Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour). AccountId (string) --- The ID of the account where this metric is located. If you are performing this operation in a monitoring account, use this to specify which source account to retrieve this metric from. MonitoredRequestCountMetric (dict) --- Use this structure to define the metric that you want to use as the 'good request' or 'bad request' value for a request-based SLO. This value observed for the metric defined in TotalRequestCountMetric will be divided by the number found for MonitoredRequestCountMetric to determine the percentage of successful requests that this SLO tracks. GoodCountMetric (list) --- If you want to count 'good requests' to determine the percentage of successful requests for this request-based SLO, specify the metric to use as 'good requests' in this structure. BadCountMetric (list) --- If you want to count 'bad requests' to determine the percentage of successful requests for this request-based SLO, specify the metric to use as 'bad requests' in this structure. DependencyConfig (dict) --- Identifies the dependency using the DependencyKeyAttributes and DependencyOperationName. (string) --- (string) --- The name of the called operation in the dependency. MetricThreshold (float) --- The value that the SLI metric is compared to. This parameter is required if this SLO is tracking the Latency metric. ComparisonOperator (string) --- The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified metric to the threshold. This parameter is required if this SLO is tracking the Latency metric.",
