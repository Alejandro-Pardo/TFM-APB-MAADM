  "description": "Returns information about events across your organization in Organizations. You can use the filters parameter to specify the events that you want to return. Events are returned in a summary form and don't include the affected accounts, detailed description, any additional metadata that depends on the event type, or any affected resources. To retrieve that information, use the following operations: If you don't specify a filter, the DescribeEventsForOrganizations returns all events across your organization. Results are sorted by lastModifiedTime, starting with the most recent event. For more information about the different types of Health events, see Event. Before you can call this operation, you must first enable Health to work with Organizations. To do this, call the EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization operation from your organization's management account.",
