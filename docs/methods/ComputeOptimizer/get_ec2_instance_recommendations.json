(dict) --- Describes a filter that returns a more specific list of recommendations. Use this filter with the  GetAutoScalingGroupRecommendations and  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations actions. You can use EBSFilter with the  GetEBSVolumeRecommendations action, LambdaFunctionRecommendationFilter with the  GetLambdaFunctionRecommendations action, and JobFilter with the  DescribeRecommendationExportJobs action. name (string) --- The name of the filter. Specify Finding to return recommendations with a specific finding classification. For example, Underprovisioned. Specify RecommendationSourceType to return recommendations of a specific resource type. For example, Ec2Instance. Specify FindingReasonCodes to return recommendations with a specific finding reason code. For example, CPUUnderprovisioned. Specify InferredWorkloadTypes to return recommendations of a specific inferred workload. For example, Redis. You can filter your EC2 instance recommendations by tag:key and tag-key tags. A tag:key is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to your recommendations. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all recommendations that have a tag with the key of Owner and the value of TeamA, specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value. A tag-key is the key of a tag assigned to your recommendations. Use this filter to find all of your recommendations that have a tag with a specific key. This doesn't consider the tag value. For example, you can find your recommendations with a tag key value of Owner or without any tag keys assigned. values (list) --- The value of the filter. The valid values for this parameter are as follows, depending on what you specify for the name parameter and the resource type that you wish to filter results for: Specify Optimized or NotOptimized if you specify the name parameter as Finding and you want to filter results for Auto Scaling groups. Specify Underprovisioned, Overprovisioned, or Optimized if you specify the name parameter as Finding and you want to filter results for EC2 instances. Specify Ec2Instance or AutoScalingGroup if you specify the name parameter as RecommendationSourceType. Specify one of the following options if you specify the name parameter as FindingReasonCodes: CPUOverprovisioned --\u0094 The instance's CPU configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. CPUUnderprovisioned --\u0094 The instance's CPU configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better CPU performance. MemoryOverprovisioned --\u0094 The instance's memory configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. MemoryUnderprovisioned --\u0094 The instance's memory configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better memory performance. EBSThroughputOverprovisioned --\u0094 The instance's EBS throughput configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. EBSThroughputUnderprovisioned --\u0094 The instance's EBS throughput configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better EBS throughput performance. EBSIOPSOverprovisioned --\u0094 The instance's EBS IOPS configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload.

NetworkBandwidthOverprovisioned --\u0094 The instance's network bandwidth configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. NetworkBandwidthUnderprovisioned --\u0094 The instance's network bandwidth configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better network bandwidth performance. This finding reason happens when the NetworkIn or NetworkOut performance of an instance is impacted. NetworkPPSOverprovisioned --\u0094 The instance's network PPS (packets per second) configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload. NetworkPPSUnderprovisioned --\u0094 The instance's network PPS (packets per second) configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better network PPS performance.
