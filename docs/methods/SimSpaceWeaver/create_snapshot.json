  "description": "Creates a snapshot of the specified simulation. A snapshot is a file that contains simulation state data at a specific time. The state data saved in a snapshot includes entity data from the State Fabric, the simulation configuration specified in the schema, and the clock tick number. You can use the snapshot to initialize a new simulation. For more information about snapshots, see Snapshots in the SimSpace Weaver User Guide. You specify a Destination when you create a snapshot. The Destination is the name of an Amazon S3 bucket and an optional ObjectKeyPrefix. The ObjectKeyPrefix is usually the name of a folder in the bucket. SimSpace Weaver creates a snapshot folder inside the Destination and places the snapshot file there. The snapshot file is an Amazon S3 object. It has an object key with the form: object-key-prefix/snapshot/simulation-name-YYMMdd-HHmm-ss.zip, where:",
