  "description": "Creates an Amazon FSx for Lustre data repository task. A CreateDataRepositoryTask operation will fail if a data repository is not linked to the FSx file system. You use import and export data repository tasks to perform bulk operations between your FSx for Lustre file system and its linked data repositories. An example of a data repository task is exporting any data and metadata changes, including POSIX metadata, to files, directories, and symbolic links (symlinks) from your FSx file system to a linked data repository. You use release data repository tasks to release data from your file system for files that are exported to S3. The metadata of released files remains on the file system so users or applications can still access released files by reading the files again, which will restore data from Amazon S3 to the FSx for Lustre file system. To learn more about data repository tasks, see Data Repository Tasks. To learn more about linking a data repository to your file system, see Linking your file system to an S3 bucket.",

The paths you provide need to be relative to the mount point of the file system.
