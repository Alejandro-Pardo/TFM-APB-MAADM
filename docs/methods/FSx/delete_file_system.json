  "description": "Deletes a file system. After deletion, the file system no longer exists, and its data is gone. Any existing automatic backups and snapshots are also deleted. To delete an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system, first delete all the volumes and storage virtual machines (SVMs) on the file system. Then provide a FileSystemId value to the DeleteFileSystem operation. By default, when you delete an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, a final backup is created upon deletion. This final backup isn't subject to the file system's retention policy, and must be manually deleted. To delete an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, first unmount it from every connected Amazon EC2 instance, then provide a FileSystemId value to the DeleteFileSystem operation. By default, Amazon FSx will not take a final backup when the DeleteFileSystem operation is invoked. On file systems not linked to an Amazon S3 bucket, set SkipFinalBackup to false to take a final backup of the file system you are deleting. Backups cannot be enabled on S3-linked file systems. To ensure all of your data is written back to S3 before deleting your file system, you can either monitor for the AgeOfOldestQueuedMessage metric to be zero (if using automatic export) or you can run an export data repository task. If you have automatic export enabled and want to use an export data repository task, you have to disable automatic export before executing the export data repository task. The DeleteFileSystem operation returns while the file system has the DELETING status. You can check the file system deletion status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns a list of file systems in your account. If you pass the file system ID for a deleted file system, the DescribeFileSystems operation returns a FileSystemNotFound error.",
