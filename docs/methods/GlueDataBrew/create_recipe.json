(dict) --- Represents an individual condition that evaluates to true or false. Conditions are used with recipe actions. The action is only performed for column values where the condition evaluates to true. If a recipe requires more than one condition, then the recipe must specify multiple ConditionExpression elements. Each condition is applied to the rows in a dataset first, before the recipe action is performed. A specific condition to apply to a recipe action.
