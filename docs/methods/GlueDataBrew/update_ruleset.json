(dict) --- Represents a single data quality requirement that should be validated in the scope of this dataset. The name of the rule. Disabled (boolean) --- A value that specifies whether the rule is disabled. Once a rule is disabled, a profile job will not validate it during a job run. Default value is false. The expression which includes column references, condition names followed by variable references, possibly grouped and combined with other conditions. For example, (:col1 starts_with :prefix1 or :col1 starts_with :prefix2) and (:col1 ends_with :suffix1 or :col1 ends_with :suffix2). Column and value references are substitution variables that should start with the --\u0098:' symbol. Depending on the context, substitution variables' values can be either an actual value or a column name. These values are defined in the SubstitutionMap. If a CheckExpression starts with a column reference, then ColumnSelectors in the rule should be null. If ColumnSelectors has been defined, then there should be no column reference in the left side of a condition, for example, is_between :val1 and :val2. For more information, see Available checks SubstitutionMap (dict) --- The map of substitution variable names to their values used in a check expression. Variable names should start with a --\u0098:' (colon). Variable values can either be actual values or column names. To differentiate between the two, column names should be enclosed in backticks, for example, \":col1\": \"`Column A`\". (string) --- (string) --- Threshold (dict) --- The threshold used with a non-aggregate check expression. Non-aggregate check expressions will be applied to each row in a specific column, and the threshold will be used to determine whether the validation succeeds. The value of a threshold. Type (string) --- The type of a threshold. Used for comparison of an actual count of rows that satisfy the rule to the threshold value. Unit (string) --- Unit of threshold value. Can be either a COUNT or PERCENTAGE of the full sample size used for validation. ColumnSelectors (list) --- List of column selectors. Selectors can be used to select columns using a name or regular expression from the dataset. Rule will be applied to selected columns. (dict) --- Selector of a column from a dataset for profile job configuration. One selector includes either a column name or a regular expression. Regex (string) --- A regular expression for selecting a column from a dataset. Name (string) --- The name of a column from a dataset.",
