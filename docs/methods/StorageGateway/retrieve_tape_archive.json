However after a tape is retrieved, it is associated with a gateway, even though it is also listed in the VTS, that is, archive. This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type. Once a tape is successfully retrieved to a gateway, it cannot be retrieved again to another gateway. You must archive the tape again before you can retrieve it to another gateway. This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.",
