  "description": "Updates the bandwidth rate limit schedule for a specified gateway. By default, gateways do not have bandwidth rate limit schedules, which means no bandwidth rate limiting is in effect. Use this to initiate or update a gateway's bandwidth rate limit schedule. This operation is supported for volume, tape, and S3 file gateways. S3 file gateways support bandwidth rate limits for upload only. FSx file gateways do not support bandwidth rate limits.",

A bandwidth rate limit interval defines a period of time on one or more days of the week, during which bandwidth rate limits are specified for uploading, downloading, or both. The hour of the day to start the bandwidth rate limit interval. The minute of the hour to start the bandwidth rate limit interval. The interval begins at the start of that minute. To begin an interval exactly at the start of the hour, use the value 0. The hour of the day to end the bandwidth rate limit interval. The minute of the hour to end the bandwidth rate limit interval. The days of the week component of the bandwidth rate limit interval, represented as ordinal numbers from 0 to 6, where 0 represents Sunday and 6 represents Saturday.
