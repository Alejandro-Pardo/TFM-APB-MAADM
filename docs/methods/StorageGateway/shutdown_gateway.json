  "description": "Shuts down a Tape Gateway or Volume Gateway. To specify which gateway to shut down, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of your request. The operation shuts down the gateway service component running in the gateway's virtual machine (VM) and not the host VM. After the gateway is shutdown, you cannot call any other API except  StartGateway,  DescribeGatewayInformation, and  ListGateways. For more information, see  ActivateGateway. Your applications cannot read from or write to the gateway's storage volumes, and there are no snapshots taken. If do not intend to use the gateway again, you must delete the gateway (using  DeleteGateway) to no longer pay software charges associated with the gateway.",
