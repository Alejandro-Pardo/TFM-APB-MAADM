  "description": "Returns the bandwidth rate limits of a gateway. By default, these limits are not set, which means no bandwidth rate limiting is in effect. This operation is supported only for the stored volume, cached volume, and tape gateway types. To describe bandwidth rate limits for S3 file gateways, use  DescribeBandwidthRateLimitSchedule. This operation returns a value for a bandwidth rate limit only if the limit is set. If no limits are set for the gateway, then this operation returns only the gateway ARN in the response body. To specify which gateway to describe, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request.",
