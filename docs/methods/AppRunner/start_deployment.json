  "description": "Initiate a manual deployment of the latest commit in a source code repository or the latest image in a source image repository to an App Runner service. For a source code repository, App Runner retrieves the commit and builds a Docker image. For a source image repository, App Runner retrieves the latest Docker image. In both cases, App Runner then deploys the new image to your service and starts a new container instance. This is an asynchronous operation. On a successful call, you can use the returned OperationId and the  ListOperations call to track the operation's progress.",
