      "description": "A CMAF packaging configuration. Encryption (dict) --- A CMAF encryption configuration. ConstantInitializationVector (string) --- An optional 128-bit, 16-byte hex value represented by a 32-character string, used in conjunction with the key for encrypting blocks. If you don't specify a value, then MediaPackage creates the constant initialization vector (IV). EncryptionContractConfiguration (dict) --- Use encryptionContractConfiguration to configure one or more content encryption keys for your endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. The encryption contract defines which content keys are used to encrypt the audio and video tracks in your stream. To configure the encryption contract, specify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note the following considerations when using encryptionContractConfiguration: encryptionContractConfiguration can be used for DASH endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You must disable key rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRotationIntervalSeconds to 0. (string) --- (dict) --- An HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration. AdMarkers (string) --- This setting controls how ad markers are included in the packaged OriginEndpoint. 'NONE' will omit all SCTE-35 ad markers from the output. 'PASSTHROUGH' causes the manifest to contain a copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (comments) taken directly from the input HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest. 'SCTE35_ENHANCED' generates ad markers and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the input source. IncludeIframeOnlyStream (boolean) --- When enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included in the output. ManifestName (string) --- An optional string to include in the name of the manifest. ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds (integer) --- The interval (in seconds) between each EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally, when an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated every 5 seconds using the ingest time of the content. If the interval is not specified, or set to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be inserted into manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parameter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata is found in HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed through to HLS output. RepeatExtXKey (boolean) --- When enabled, the EXT-X-KEY tag will be repeated in output manifests. StreamSelection (dict) --- A StreamSelection configuration. MaxVideoBitsPerSecond (integer) --- The maximum video bitrate (bps) to include in output. MinVideoBitsPerSecond (integer) --- The minimum video bitrate (bps) to include in output. StreamOrder (string) --- A directive that determines the order of streams in the output. IncludeEncoderConfigurationInSegments (boolean) --- When includeEncoderConfigurationInSegments is set to true, MediaPackage places your encoder's Sequence Parameter Set (SPS), Picture Parameter Set (PPS), and Video Parameter Set (VPS) metadata in every video segment instead of in the init fragment. This lets you use different SPS/PPS/VPS settings for your assets during content playback. SegmentDurationSeconds (integer) --- Duration (in seconds) of each fragment. Actual fragments will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the source fragment duration.",

ConstantInitializationVector (string) --- A constant initialization vector for encryption (optional). When not specified the initialization vector will be periodically rotated. EncryptionMethod (string) --- The encryption method to use. EncryptionContractConfiguration (dict) --- Use encryptionContractConfiguration to configure one or more content encryption keys for your endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. The encryption contract defines which content keys are used to encrypt the audio and video tracks in your stream. To configure the encryption contract, specify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note the following considerations when using encryptionContractConfiguration: encryptionContractConfiguration can be used for DASH endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You must disable key rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRotationIntervalSeconds to 0. (string) --- (dict) --- An HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration. AdMarkers (string) --- This setting controls how ad markers are included in the packaged OriginEndpoint. 'NONE' will omit all SCTE-35 ad markers from the output. 'PASSTHROUGH' causes the manifest to contain a copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (comments) taken directly from the input HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest. 'SCTE35_ENHANCED' generates ad markers and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the input source. IncludeIframeOnlyStream (boolean) --- When enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included in the output. ManifestName (string) --- An optional string to include in the name of the manifest. ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds (integer) --- The interval (in seconds) between each EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally, when an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated every 5 seconds using the ingest time of the content. If the interval is not specified, or set to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be inserted into manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parameter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata is found in HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed through to HLS output. RepeatExtXKey (boolean) --- When enabled, the EXT-X-KEY tag will be repeated in output manifests. StreamSelection (dict) --- A StreamSelection configuration. MaxVideoBitsPerSecond (integer) --- The maximum video bitrate (bps) to include in output. MinVideoBitsPerSecond (integer) --- The minimum video bitrate (bps) to include in output. StreamOrder (string) --- A directive that determines the order of streams in the output. IncludeDvbSubtitles (boolean) --- When enabled, MediaPackage passes through digital video broadcasting (DVB) subtitles into the output. SegmentDurationSeconds (integer) --- Duration (in seconds) of each fragment. Actual fragments will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the source fragment duration. UseAudioRenditionGroup (boolean) --- When enabled, audio streams will be placed in rendition groups in the output.",
