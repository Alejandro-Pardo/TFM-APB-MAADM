  "description": "Starts the classification and analysis of an input document. StartLendingAnalysis initiates the classification and analysis of a packet of lending documents. StartLendingAnalysis operates on a document file located in an Amazon S3 bucket. StartLendingAnalysis can analyze text in documents that are in one of the following formats: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, PDF. Use DocumentLocation to specify the bucket name and the file name of the document. StartLendingAnalysis returns a job identifier ( JobId) that you use to get the results of the operation. When the text analysis is finished, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you specify in NotificationChannel. To get the results of the text analysis operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If the status is SUCCEEDED you can call either GetLendingAnalysis or GetLendingAnalysisSummary and provide the JobId to obtain the results of the analysis. If using OutputConfig to specify an Amazon S3 bucket, the output will be contained within the specified prefix in a directory labeled with the job-id. In the directory there are 3 sub-directories:",

OutputConfig is an optional parameter which lets you adjust where your output will be placed. By default, Amazon Textract will store the results internally and can only be accessed by the Get API operations. With OutputConfig enabled, you can set the name of the bucket the output will be sent to the file prefix of the results where you can download your results. Additionally, you can set the KMSKeyID parameter to a customer master key (CMK) to encrypt your output. Without this parameter set Amazon Textract will encrypt server-side using the AWS managed CMK for Amazon S3. Decryption of Customer Content is necessary for processing of the documents by Amazon Textract. If your account is opted out under an AI services opt out policy then all unencrypted Customer Content is immediately and permanently deleted after the Customer Content has been processed by the service. No copy of of the output is retained by Amazon Textract. For information about how to opt out, see Managing AI services opt-out policy. For more information on data privacy, see the Data Privacy FAQ.
