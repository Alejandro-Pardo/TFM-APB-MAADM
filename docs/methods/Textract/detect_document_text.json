  "description": "Detects text in the input document. Amazon Textract can detect lines of text and the words that make up a line of text. The input document must be in one of the following image formats: JPEG, PNG, PDF, or TIFF. DetectDocumentText returns the detected text in an array of  Block objects. Each document page has as an associated Block of type PAGE. Each PAGE Block object is the parent of LINE Block objects that represent the lines of detected text on a page. A LINE Block object is a parent for each word that makes up the line. Words are represented by Block objects of type WORD. DetectDocumentText is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use  StartDocumentTextDetection. For more information, see Document Text Detection.",
