  "description": "Starts the asynchronous analysis of invoices or receipts for data like contact information, items purchased, and vendor names. StartExpenseAnalysis can analyze text in documents that are in JPEG, PNG, and PDF format. The documents must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use the  DocumentLocation parameter to specify the name of your S3 bucket and the name of the document in that bucket. StartExpenseAnalysis returns a job identifier ( JobId) that you will provide to GetExpenseAnalysis to retrieve the results of the operation. When the analysis of the input invoices/receipts is finished, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you provide to the NotificationChannel. To obtain the results of the invoice and receipt analysis operation, ensure that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call  GetExpenseAnalysis, and pass the job identifier ( JobId) that was returned by your call to StartExpenseAnalysis. For more information, see Analyzing Invoices and Receipts.",
