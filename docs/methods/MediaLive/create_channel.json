If no explicit xPosition is provided, the horizontal caption position will be determined by the alignment parameter. YPosition (integer) --- Specifies the vertical position of the caption relative to the top of the output in pixels. A value of 10 would result in the captions starting 10 pixels from the top of the output. If no explicit yPosition is provided, the caption will be positioned towards the bottom of the output. DvbSubDestinationSettings (dict) --- Dvb Sub Destination Settings Alignment (string) --- If no explicit xPosition or yPosition is provided, setting alignment to centered will place the captions at the bottom center of the output. This option is not valid for source captions that are STL or 608/embedded. Leaving this parameter blank is equivalent to setting it to 0 (transparent). FontSize (string) --- When set to auto fontSize will scale depending on the size of the output.

DISABLED: Leave the gap unfilled FontFamily (string) --- Specifies the font family to include in the font data attached to the EBU-TT captions. Valid only if style_control is set to include. (If style_control is set to exclude, the font family is always set to monospaced.) Enter a list of font families, as a comma-separated list of font names, in order of preference. The name can be a font family (such as Arial), or a generic font family (such as serif), or default (to let the downstream player choose the font). Or leave blank to set the family to monospace. Note that you can specify only the font family. All other style information (color, bold, position and so on) is copied from the input captions. The size is always set to 100% to allow the downstream player to choose the size. StyleControl (string) --- Specifies the style information to include in the font data that is attached to the EBU-TT captions. INCLUDE: Take the style information from the source captions and include that information in the font data attached to the EBU-TT captions.

This is commonly set to enabled for music channels with less than one video frame per second. OutputLockingSettings (dict) --- Advanced output locking settings EpochLockingSettings (dict) --- Epoch Locking Settings CustomEpoch (string) --- Optional. Enter a value here to use a custom epoch, instead of the standard epoch (which started at 1970-01-01T00:00:00 UTC). Specify the start time of the custom epoch, in YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS in UTC. The time must be 2000-01-01T00:00:00 or later. Always set the MM:SS portion to 00:00. JamSyncTime (string) --- Optional. Enter a time for the jam sync. The default is midnight UTC. When epoch locking is enabled, MediaLive performs a daily jam sync on every output encode to ensure timecodes don't diverge from the wall clock.

One CLOSED-CAPTION line is added for each Language Code you specify. Make sure to specify the languages in the order in which they appear in the original source (if the source is embedded format) or the order of the caption selectors (if the source is other than embedded). Otherwise, languages in the manifest will not match up properly with the output captions. none: Include CLOSED-CAPTIONS=NONE line in the manifest. omit: Omit any CLOSED-CAPTIONS line from the manifest. ClientCache (string) --- When set to 'disabled', sets the #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no tag in the manifest, which prevents clients from saving media segments for later replay. CodecSpecification (string) --- Specification to use (RFC-6381 or the default RFC-4281) during m3u8 playlist generation. ConstantIv (string) --- For use with encryptionType. This is a 128-bit, 16-byte hex value represented by a 32-character text string. If ivSource is set to 'explicit' then this parameter is required and is used as the IV for encryption. DestinationRefId (string) --- Placeholder documentation for __string DirectoryStructure (string) --- Place segments in subdirectories. DiscontinuityTags (string) --- Specifies whether to insert EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY tags in the HLS child manifests for this output group. Typically, choose Insert because these tags are required in the manifest (according to the HLS specification) and serve an important purpose. Choose Never Insert only if the downstream system is doing real-time failover (without using the MediaLive automatic failover feature) and only if that downstream system has advised you to exclude the tags. EncryptionType (string) --- Encrypts the segments with the given encryption scheme. Exclude this parameter if no encryption is desired.

STANDARD: Create an I-frame-only manifest for each output that contains video, as well as the other manifests (according to the Output Selection field). The I-frame manifest contains a #EXT-X-I-FRAMES-ONLY tag to indicate it is I-frame only, and one or more #EXT-X-BYTERANGE entries identifying the I-frame position. For example, #EXT-X-BYTERANGE:160364@1461888' IncompleteSegmentBehavior (string) --- Specifies whether to include the final (incomplete) segment in the media output when the pipeline stops producing output because of a channel stop, a channel pause or a loss of input to the pipeline. Auto means that MediaLive decides whether to include the final segment, depending on the channel class and the types of output groups. Suppress means to never include the incomplete segment. We recommend you choose Auto and let MediaLive control the behavior. IndexNSegments (integer) --- Applies only if Mode field is LIVE. Specifies the maximum number of segments in the media manifest file. After this maximum, older segments are removed from the media manifest. This number must be smaller than the number in the Keep Segments field. InputLossAction (string) --- Parameter that control output group behavior on input loss. IvInManifest (string) --- For use with encryptionType. The IV (Initialization Vector) is a 128-bit number used in conjunction with the key for encrypting blocks. If set to 'include', IV is listed in the manifest, otherwise the IV is not in the manifest. IvSource (string) --- For use with encryptionType. If this setting is 'followsSegmentNumber', it will cause the IV to change every segment (to match the segment number). If this is set to 'explicit', you must enter a constantIv value. KeepSegments (integer) --- Applies only if Mode field is LIVE. Specifies the number of media segments to retain in the destination directory. This number should be bigger than indexNSegments (Num segments). We recommend (value = (2 x indexNsegments) + 1). If this 'keep segments' number is too low, the following might happen: the player is still reading a media manifest file that lists this segment, but that segment has been removed from the destination directory (as directed by indexNSegments). This situation would result in a 404 HTTP error on the player. KeyFormat (string) --- The value specifies how the key is represented in the resource identified by the URI. If parameter is absent, an implicit value of 'identity' is used. A reverse DNS string can also be given. KeyFormatVersions (string) --- Either a single positive integer version value or a slash delimited list of version values (1/2/3). KeyProviderSettings (dict) --- The key provider settings.

MinSegmentLength (integer) --- Minimum length of MPEG-2 Transport Stream segments in seconds. When set, minimum segment length is enforced by looking ahead and back within the specified range for a nearby avail and extending the segment size if needed. Mode (string) --- If 'vod', all segments are indexed and kept permanently in the destination and manifest. If 'live', only the number segments specified in keepSegments and indexNSegments are kept; newer segments replace older segments, which may prevent players from rewinding all the way to the beginning of the event. VOD mode uses HLS EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE of EVENT while the channel is running, converting it to a 'VOD' type manifest on completion of the stream. OutputSelection (string) --- MANIFESTS_AND_SEGMENTS: Generates manifests (master manifest, if applicable, and media manifests) for this output group. VARIANT_MANIFESTS_AND_SEGMENTS: Generates media manifests for this output group, but not a master manifest. SEGMENTS_ONLY: Does not generate any manifests for this output group. ProgramDateTime (string) --- Includes or excludes EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag in .m3u8 manifest files. The value is calculated using the program date time clock. ProgramDateTimeClock (string) --- Specifies the algorithm used to drive the HLS EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME clock. Options include: INITIALIZE_FROM_OUTPUT_TIMECODE: The PDT clock is initialized as a function of the first output timecode, then incremented by the EXTINF duration of each encoded segment. SYSTEM_CLOCK: The PDT clock is initialized as a function of the UTC wall clock, then incremented by the EXTINF duration of each encoded segment. If the PDT clock diverges from the wall clock by more than 500ms, it is resynchronized to the wall clock. ProgramDateTimePeriod (integer) --- Period of insertion of EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME entry, in seconds. RedundantManifest (string) --- ENABLED: The master manifest (.m3u8 file) for each pipeline includes information about both pipelines: first its own media files, then the media files of the other pipeline. This feature allows playout device that support stale manifest detection to switch from one manifest to the other, when the current manifest seems to be stale. There are still two destinations and two master manifests, but both master manifests reference the media files from both pipelines. DISABLED: The master manifest (.m3u8 file) for each pipeline includes information about its own pipeline only. For an HLS output group with MediaPackage as the destination, the DISABLED behavior is always followed. MediaPackage regenerates the manifests it serves to players so a redundant manifest from MediaLive is irrelevant. SegmentLength (integer) --- Length of MPEG-2 Transport Stream segments to create in seconds. Note that segments will end on the next keyframe after this duration, so actual segment length may be longer. SegmentationMode (string) --- useInputSegmentation has been deprecated. The configured segment size is always used. SegmentsPerSubdirectory (integer) --- Number of segments to write to a subdirectory before starting a new one. directoryStructure must be subdirectoryPerStream for this setting to have an effect.

The media manifest includes #EXT-X-BYTERANGE tags to index segments for playback. A typical use for this value is when sending the output to AWS Elemental MediaConvert, which can accept only a single media file. Playback while the channel is running is not guaranteed due to HTTP server caching. MediaPackageGroupSettings (dict) --- Media Package Group Settings DestinationRefId (string) --- Placeholder documentation for __string MsSmoothGroupSettings (dict) --- Ms Smooth Group Settings AcquisitionPointId (string) --- The ID to include in each message in the sparse track. Ignored if sparseTrackType is NONE. AudioOnlyTimecodeControl (string) --- If set to passthrough for an audio-only MS Smooth output, the fragment absolute time will be set to the current timecode.

SendDelayMs (integer) --- Number of milliseconds to delay the output from the second pipeline. SparseTrackType (string) --- Identifies the type of data to place in the sparse track: - SCTE35: Insert SCTE-35 messages from the source content. With each message, insert an IDR frame to start a new segment. - SCTE35_WITHOUT_SEGMENTATION: Insert SCTE-35 messages from the source content. With each message, insert an IDR frame but don't start a new segment. - NONE: Don't generate a sparse track for any outputs in this output group.

MediaLive will create a message based on the content of each SCTE-35 message, format it for that marker type, and insert it in the datastream. (string) --- Rtmp Ad Markers AuthenticationScheme (string) --- Authentication scheme to use when connecting with CDN CacheFullBehavior (string) --- Controls behavior when content cache fills up. If remote origin server stalls the RTMP connection and does not accept content fast enough the --\u0098Media Cache' will fill up. When the cache reaches the duration specified by cacheLength the cache will stop accepting new content. If set to disconnectImmediately, the RTMP output will force a disconnect. Clear the media cache, and reconnect after restartDelay seconds. If set to waitForServer, the RTMP output will wait up to 5 minutes to allow the origin server to begin accepting data again. CacheLength (integer) --- Cache length, in seconds, is used to calculate buffer size. CaptionData (string) --- Controls the types of data that passes to onCaptionInfo outputs. If set to --\u0098all' then 608 and 708 carried DTVCC data will be passed. If set to --\u0098field1AndField2608' then DTVCC data will be stripped out, but 608 data from both fields will be passed. If set to --\u0098field1608' then only the data carried in 608 from field 1 video will be passed. InputLossAction (string) --- Controls the behavior of this RTMP group if input becomes unavailable. - emitOutput: Emit a slate until input returns. - pauseOutput: Stop transmitting data until input returns. This does not close the underlying RTMP connection. IncludeFillerNalUnits (string) --- Applies only when the rate control mode (in the codec settings) is CBR (constant bit rate). Controls whether the RTMP output stream is padded (with FILL NAL units) in order to achieve a constant bit rate that is truly constant. When there is no padding, the bandwidth varies (up to the bitrate value in the codec settings). We recommend that you choose Auto. UdpGroupSettings (dict) --- Udp Group Settings InputLossAction (string) --- Specifies behavior of last resort when input video is lost, and no more backup inputs are available. When dropTs is selected the entire transport stream will stop being emitted. When dropProgram is selected the program can be dropped from the transport stream (and replaced with null packets to meet the TS bitrate requirement). Or, when emitProgram is chosen the transport stream will continue to be produced normally with repeat frames, black frames, or slate frames substituted for the absent input video. CmafIngestGroupSettings (dict) --- Cmaf Ingest Group Settings DestinationRefId (string) --- Placeholder documentation for __string NielsenId3Behavior (string) --- If set to passthrough, Nielsen inaudible tones for media tracking will be detected in the input audio and an equivalent ID3 tag will be inserted in the output.

EbpLookaheadMs (integer) --- When set, enforces that Encoder Boundary Points do not come within the specified time interval of each other by looking ahead at input video. If another EBP is going to come in within the specified time interval, the current EBP is not emitted, and the segment is 'stretched' to the next marker. The lookahead value does not add latency to the system. The Live Event must be configured elsewhere to create sufficient latency to make the lookahead accurate.

This parameter is effective only when the PCR PID is the same as the video or audio elementary stream. PcrPeriod (integer) --- Maximum time in milliseconds between Program Clock Reference (PCRs) inserted into the transport stream. PcrPid (string) --- Packet Identifier (PID) of the Program Clock Reference (PCR) in the transport stream. When no value is given, the encoder will assign the same value as the Video PID.

SegmentationMarkers (string) --- Inserts segmentation markers at each segmentationTime period. raiSegstart sets the Random Access Indicator bit in the adaptation field. raiAdapt sets the RAI bit and adds the current timecode in the private data bytes. psiSegstart inserts PAT and PMT tables at the start of segments. ebp adds Encoder Boundary Point information to the adaptation field as per OpenCable specification OC-SP-EBP-I01-130118. ebpLegacy adds Encoder Boundary Point information to the adaptation field using a legacy proprietary format. SegmentationStyle (string) --- The segmentation style parameter controls how segmentation markers are inserted into the transport stream. With avails, it is possible that segments may be truncated, which can influence where future segmentation markers are inserted. When a segmentation style of 'resetCadence' is selected and a segment is truncated due to an avail, we will reset the segmentation cadence. This means the subsequent segment will have a duration of $segmentationTime seconds. When a segmentation style of 'maintainCadence' is selected and a segment is truncated due to an avail, we will not reset the segmentation cadence. This means the subsequent segment will likely be truncated as well. However, all segments after that will have a duration of $segmentationTime seconds. Note that EBP lookahead is a slight exception to this rule. SegmentationTime (float) --- The length in seconds of each segment. Required unless markers is set to _none_. TimedMetadataBehavior (string) --- When set to passthrough, timed metadata will be passed through from input to output. TimedMetadataPid (string) --- Packet Identifier (PID) of the timed metadata stream in the transport stream. TransportStreamId (integer) --- The value of the transport stream ID field in the Program Map Table. VideoPid (string) --- Packet Identifier (PID) of the elementary video stream in the transport stream. Scte35PrerollPullupMilliseconds (float) --- Defines the amount SCTE-35 preroll will be increased (in milliseconds) on the output. Preroll is the amount of time between the presence of a SCTE-35 indication in a transport stream and the PTS of the video frame it references. Zero means don't add pullup (it doesn't mean set the preroll to zero). Negative pullup is not supported, which means that you can't make the preroll shorter. Be aware that latency in the output will increase by the pullup amount. RawSettings (dict) --- Raw Settings Extension (string) --- Output file extension. If excluded, this will be auto-selected from the container type. NameModifier (string) --- String concatenated to the end of the destination filename. Required for multiple outputs of the same type.

This will cause rtmps outputs with self-signed certificates to fail. ConnectionRetryInterval (integer) --- Number of seconds to wait before retrying a connection to the Flash Media server if the connection is lost. DestinationRefId (string) --- Placeholder documentation for __string NumRetries (integer) --- Number of retry attempts. UdpOutputSettings (dict) --- Udp Output Settings BufferMsec (integer) --- UDP output buffering in milliseconds.

If Row FEC is used, then this is the number of transport stream packets per row error correction packet, and the value must be between 4 and 20, inclusive, if includeFec is columnAndRow. If includeFec is column, this value must be 1 to 20, inclusive. CmafIngestOutputSettings (dict) --- Cmaf Ingest Output Settings NameModifier (string) --- String concatenated to the end of the destination filename. SrtOutputSettings (dict) --- Srt Output Settings BufferMsec (integer) --- SRT output buffering in milliseconds. A higher value increases latency through the encoder. But the benefits are that it helps to maintain a constant, low-jitter SRT output, and it accommodates clock recovery, input switching, input disruptions, picture reordering, and so on. Range: 0-10000 milliseconds. DestinationRefId (string) --- Placeholder documentation for __string EncryptionType (string) --- The encryption level for the content. Valid values are AES128, AES192, AES256. You and the downstream system should plan how to set this field because the values must not conflict with each other. Latency (integer) --- The latency value, in milliseconds, that is proposed during the SRT connection handshake. SRT will choose the maximum of the values proposed by the sender and receiver. On the sender side, latency is the amount of time a packet is held to give it a chance to be delivered successfully. On the receiver side, latency is the amount of time the packet is held before delivering to the application, aiding in packet recovery and matching as closely as possible the packet timing of the sender. Range: 40-16000 milliseconds. VideoDescriptionName (string) --- The name of the VideoDescription used as the source for this output.

There are three types of adaptive quantization: flicker, spatial, and temporal. Set the field in one of these ways: Set to Auto. Recommended. For each type of AQ, MediaLive will determine if AQ is needed, and if so, the appropriate strength. Set a strength (a value other than Auto or Disable). This strength will apply to any of the AQ fields that you choose to enable. Set to Disabled to disable all types of adaptive quantization. AfdSignaling (string) --- Indicates that AFD values will be written into the output stream. If afdSignaling is 'auto', the system will try to preserve the input AFD value (in cases where multiple AFD values are valid). If set to 'fixed', the AFD value will be the value configured in the fixedAfd parameter. Bitrate (integer) --- Average bitrate in bits/second. Required when the rate control mode is VBR or CBR. Not used for QVBR. In an MS Smooth output group, each output must have a unique value when its bitrate is rounded down to the nearest multiple of 1000.

We recommend that you try both filters and observe the results to decide which one to use. The Temporal Filter reduces bandwidth by removing imperceptible details in the content. It combines perceptual filtering and motion compensated temporal filtering (MCTF). It operates independently of the compression level. The Bandwidth Reduction filter is a perceptual filter located within the encoding loop. It adapts to the current compression level to filter imperceptible signals. This filter works only when the resolution is 1080p or lower. TemporalFilterSettings (dict) --- Temporal Filter Settings PostFilterSharpening (string) --- If you enable this filter, the results are the following: - If the source content is noisy (it contains excessive digital artifacts), the filter cleans up the source. - If the source content is already clean, the filter tends to decrease the bitrate, especially when the rate control mode is QVBR. Strength (string) --- Choose a filter strength. We recommend a strength of 1 or 2. A higher strength might take out good information, resulting in an image that is overly soft. BandwidthReductionFilterSettings (dict) --- Bandwidth Reduction Filter Settings PostFilterSharpening (string) --- Configures the sharpening control, which is available when the bandwidth reduction filter is enabled. This control sharpens edges and contours, which produces a specific artistic effect that you might want. We recommend that you test each of the values (including DISABLED) to observe the sharpening effect on the content. Strength (string) --- Enables the bandwidth reduction filter. The filter strengths range from 1 to 4. We recommend that you always enable this filter and use AUTO, to let MediaLive apply the optimum filtering for the context. FixedAfd (string) --- Four bit AFD value to write on all frames of video in the output stream. Only valid when afdSignaling is set to --\u0098Fixed'. FlickerAq (string) --- Flicker AQ makes adjustments within each frame to reduce flicker or --\u0098pop' on I-frames. The value to enter in this field depends on the value in the Adaptive quantization field: If you have set the Adaptive quantization field to Auto, MediaLive ignores any value in this field. MediaLive will determine if flicker AQ is appropriate and will apply the appropriate strength. If you have set the Adaptive quantization field to a strength, you can set this field to Enabled or Disabled. Enabled: MediaLive will apply flicker AQ using the specified strength. Disabled: MediaLive won't apply flicker AQ. If you have set the Adaptive quantization to Disabled, MediaLive ignores any value in this field and doesn't apply flicker AQ. ForceFieldPictures (string) --- This setting applies only when scan type is 'interlaced.' It controls whether coding is performed on a field basis or on a frame basis. (When the video is progressive, the coding is always performed on a frame basis.) enabled: Force MediaLive to code on a field basis, so that odd and even sets of fields are coded separately. disabled: Code the two sets of fields separately (on a field basis) or together (on a frame basis using PAFF), depending on what is most appropriate for the content. FramerateControl (string) --- This field indicates how the output video frame rate is specified. If 'specified' is selected then the output video frame rate is determined by framerateNumerator and framerateDenominator, else if 'initializeFromSource' is selected then the output video frame rate will be set equal to the input video frame rate of the first input. FramerateDenominator (integer) --- Framerate denominator. FramerateNumerator (integer) --- Framerate numerator - framerate is a fraction, e.g. 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps. GopBReference (string) --- Documentation update needed GopClosedCadence (integer) --- Frequency of closed GOPs. In streaming applications, it is recommended that this be set to 1 so a decoder joining mid-stream will receive an IDR frame as quickly as possible. Setting this value to 0 will break output segmenting. GopNumBFrames (integer) --- Number of B-frames between reference frames. GopSize (float) --- GOP size (keyframe interval) in units of either frames or seconds per gopSizeUnits. If gopSizeUnits is frames, gopSize must be an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. If gopSizeUnits is seconds, gopSize must be greater than 0, but need not be an integer. GopSizeUnits (string) --- Indicates if the gopSize is specified in frames or seconds. If seconds the system will convert the gopSize into a frame count at run time. Level (string) --- H.264 Level. LookAheadRateControl (string) --- Amount of lookahead. A value of low can decrease latency and memory usage, while high can produce better quality for certain content. MaxBitrate (integer) --- For QVBR: See the tooltip for Quality level For VBR: Set the maximum bitrate in order to accommodate expected spikes in the complexity of the video. MinIInterval (integer) --- Only meaningful if sceneChangeDetect is set to enabled. Defaults to 5 if multiplex rate control is used. Enforces separation between repeated (cadence) I-frames and I-frames inserted by Scene Change Detection. If a scene change I-frame is within I-interval frames of a cadence I-frame, the GOP is shrunk and/or stretched to the scene change I-frame. GOP stretch requires enabling lookahead as well as setting I-interval. The normal cadence resumes for the next GOP. Note: Maximum GOP stretch = GOP size + Min-I-interval - 1 NumRefFrames (integer) --- Number of reference frames to use. The encoder may use more than requested if using B-frames and/or interlaced encoding. ParControl (string) --- This field indicates how the output pixel aspect ratio is specified. If 'specified' is selected then the output video pixel aspect ratio is determined by parNumerator and parDenominator, else if 'initializeFromSource' is selected then the output pixsel aspect ratio will be set equal to the input video pixel aspect ratio of the first input. ParDenominator (integer) --- Pixel Aspect Ratio denominator. ParNumerator (integer) --- Pixel Aspect Ratio numerator. Profile (string) --- H.264 Profile. QualityLevel (string) --- Leave as STANDARD_QUALITY or choose a different value (which might result in additional costs to run the channel). - ENHANCED_QUALITY: Produces a slightly better video quality without an increase in the bitrate. Has an effect only when the Rate control mode is QVBR or CBR. If this channel is in a MediaLive multiplex, the value must be ENHANCED_QUALITY. - STANDARD_QUALITY: Valid for any Rate control mode. QvbrQualityLevel (integer) --- Controls the target quality for the video encode. Applies only when the rate control mode is QVBR. You can set a target quality or you can let MediaLive determine the best quality. To set a target quality, enter values in the QVBR quality level field and the Max bitrate field. Enter values that suit your most important viewing devices. Recommended values are: - Primary screen: Quality level: 8 to 10. Max bitrate: 4M - PC or tablet: Quality level: 7. Max bitrate: 1.5M to 3M - Smartphone: Quality level: 6. Max bitrate: 1M to 1.5M To let MediaLive decide, leave the QVBR quality level field empty, and in Max bitrate enter the maximum rate you want in the video. For more information, see the section called 'Video - rate control mode' in the MediaLive user guide RateControlMode (string) --- Rate control mode. QVBR: Quality will match the specified quality level except when it is constrained by the maximum bitrate. Recommended if you or your viewers pay for bandwidth. VBR: Quality and bitrate vary, depending on the video complexity. Recommended instead of QVBR if you want to maintain a specific average bitrate over the duration of the channel. CBR: Quality varies, depending on the video complexity. Recommended only if you distribute your assets to devices that cannot handle variable bitrates. Multiplex: This rate control mode is only supported (and is required) when the video is being delivered to a MediaLive Multiplex in which case the rate control configuration is controlled by the properties within the Multiplex Program. ScanType (string) --- Sets the scan type of the output to progressive or top-field-first interlaced. SceneChangeDetect (string) --- Scene change detection. - On: inserts I-frames when scene change is detected. - Off: does not force an I-frame when scene change is detected. Slices (integer) --- Number of slices per picture. Must be less than or equal to the number of macroblock rows for progressive pictures, and less than or equal to half the number of macroblock rows for interlaced pictures. This field is optional; when no value is specified the encoder will choose the number of slices based on encode resolution. Softness (integer) --- Softness. Selects quantizer matrix, larger values reduce high-frequency content in the encoded image. If not set to zero, must be greater than 15. SpatialAq (string) --- Spatial AQ makes adjustments within each frame based on spatial variation of content complexity. MediaLive will determine if spatial AQ is appropriate and will apply the appropriate strength. Enabled: MediaLive will apply spatial AQ using the specified strength. Disabled: MediaLive won't apply spatial AQ. If you have set the Adaptive quantization to Disabled, MediaLive ignores any value in this field and doesn't apply spatial AQ. SubgopLength (string) --- If set to fixed, use gopNumBFrames B-frames per sub-GOP. If set to dynamic, optimize the number of B-frames used for each sub-GOP to improve visual quality. Syntax (string) --- Produces a bitstream compliant with SMPTE RP-2027. TemporalAq (string) --- Temporal makes adjustments within each frame based on temporal variation of content complexity. MediaLive will determine if temporal AQ is appropriate and will apply the appropriate strength. Enabled: MediaLive will apply temporal AQ using the specified strength. Disabled: MediaLive won't apply temporal AQ. If you have set the Adaptive quantization to Disabled, MediaLive ignores any value in this field and doesn't apply temporal AQ.

The tile height must result in 22 or fewer rows in the frame. The tile width must result in 20 or fewer columns in the frame. And finally, the product of the column count and row count must be 64 of less. If the tile width and height are specified, MediaLive will override the video codec slices field with a value that MediaLive calculates TilePadding (string) --- Set to 'padded' to force MediaLive to add padding to the frame, to obtain a frame that is a whole multiple of the tile size. If you are setting up the picture as a tile, you must enter 'padded'. In all other configurations, you typically enter 'none'. TileWidth (integer) --- Set this field to set up the picture as a tile. See tileHeight for more information. TreeblockSize (string) --- Select the tree block size used for encoding. If you enter 'auto', the encoder will pick the best size.

Deblocking (string) --- Enable or disable the deblocking filter for this codec. The filter reduces blocking artifacts at block boundaries, which improves overall video quality. If the filter is disabled, visible block edges might appear in the output, especially at lower bitrates. Mpeg2Settings (dict) --- Mpeg2 Settings AdaptiveQuantization (string) --- Choose Off to disable adaptive quantization. Or choose another value to enable the quantizer and set its strength. The strengths are: Auto, Off, Low, Medium, High. When you enable this field, MediaLive allows intra-frame quantizers to vary, which might improve visual quality. AfdSignaling (string) --- Indicates the AFD values that MediaLive will write into the video encode. If you do not know what AFD signaling is, or if your downstream system has not given you guidance, choose AUTO. AUTO: MediaLive will try to preserve the input AFD value (in cases where multiple AFD values are valid). FIXED: MediaLive will use the value you specify in fixedAFD. ColorMetadata (string) --- Specifies whether to include the color space metadata. The metadata describes the color space that applies to the video (the colorSpace field). We recommend that you insert the metadata. ColorSpace (string) --- Choose the type of color space conversion to apply to the output. For detailed information on setting up both the input and the output to obtain the desired color space in the output, see the section on \"MediaLive Features - Video - color space\" in the MediaLive User Guide. PASSTHROUGH: Keep the color space of the input content - do not convert it. AUTO:Convert all content that is SD to rec 601, and convert all content that is HD to rec 709. DisplayAspectRatio (string) --- Sets the pixel aspect ratio for the encode. FilterSettings (dict) --- Optionally specify a noise reduction filter, which can improve quality of compressed content. If you do not choose a filter, no filter will be applied. TEMPORAL: This filter is useful for both source content that is noisy (when it has excessive digital artifacts) and source content that is clean. When the content is noisy, the filter cleans up the source content before the encoding phase, with these two effects: First, it improves the output video quality because the content has been cleaned up. Secondly, it decreases the bandwidth because MediaLive does not waste bits on encoding noise. When the content is reasonably clean, the filter tends to decrease the bitrate. FixedAfd (string) --- Complete this field only when afdSignaling is set to FIXED. Enter the AFD value (4 bits) to write on all frames of the video encode. GopClosedCadence (integer) --- MPEG2: default is open GOP. GopNumBFrames (integer) --- Relates to the GOP structure. The number of B-frames between reference frames. If you do not know what a B-frame is, use the default. GopSize (float) --- Relates to the GOP structure. The GOP size (keyframe interval) in the units specified in gopSizeUnits. If you do not know what GOP is, use the default. If gopSizeUnits is frames, then the gopSize must be an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. If gopSizeUnits is seconds, the gopSize must be greater than 0, but does not need to be an integer. GopSizeUnits (string) --- Relates to the GOP structure. Specifies whether the gopSize is specified in frames or seconds. If you do not plan to change the default gopSize, leave the default. If you specify SECONDS, MediaLive will internally convert the gop size to a frame count. ScanType (string) --- Set the scan type of the output to PROGRESSIVE or INTERLACED (top field first). SubgopLength (string) --- Relates to the GOP structure. FIXED: Set the number of B-frames in each sub-GOP to the value in gopNumBFrames. DYNAMIC: Let MediaLive optimize the number of B-frames in each sub-GOP, to improve visual quality. TimecodeInsertion (string) --- Determines how MediaLive inserts timecodes in the output video.

GopSizeUnits (string) --- Choose the units for the GOP size: FRAMES or SECONDS. For SECONDS, MediaLive converts the size into a frame count at run time. Level (string) --- Sets the level. This parameter is one of the properties of the encoding scheme for AV1. LookAheadRateControl (string) --- Sets the amount of lookahead. A value of LOW can decrease latency and memory usage. A value of HIGH can produce better quality for certain content. MaxBitrate (integer) --- The maximum bitrate to assign. For recommendations, see the description for qvbrQualityLevel. MinIInterval (integer) --- Applies only if you enable SceneChangeDetect. Sets the interval between frames. This property ensures a minimum separation between repeated (cadence) I-frames and any I-frames inserted by scene change detection (SCD frames). Enter a number for the interval, measured in number of frames. If an SCD frame and a cadence frame are closer than the specified number of frames, MediaLive shrinks or stretches the GOP to include the SCD frame. Then normal cadence resumes in the next GOP. For GOP stretch to succeed, you must enable LookAheadRateControl. Note that the maximum GOP stretch = (GOP size) + (Minimum I-interval) - 1 ParDenominator (integer) --- The denominator for the output pixel aspect ratio (PAR). ParNumerator (integer) --- The numerator for the output pixel aspect ratio (PAR). With QVBR rate control mode, the final quality is the target quality, constrained by the maxBitrate. Set values for the qvbrQualityLevel property and maxBitrate property that suit your most important viewing devices. To let MediaLive set the quality level (AUTO mode), leave the qvbrQualityLevel field empty. In this case, MediaLive uses the maximum bitrate, and the quality follows from that: more complex content might have a lower quality. Or set a target quality level and a maximum bitrate. With more complex content, MediaLive will try to achieve the target quality, but it won't exceed the maximum bitrate. With less complex content, This option will use only the bitrate needed to reach the target quality. Recommended values are: Primary screen: qvbrQualityLevel: Leave empty. maxBitrate: 4,000,000 PC or tablet: qvbrQualityLevel: Leave empty. maxBitrate: 1,500,000 to 3,000,000 Smartphone: qvbrQualityLevel: Leave empty. maxBitrate: 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 SceneChangeDetect (string) --- Controls whether MediaLive inserts I-frames when it detects a scene change. ENABLED or DISABLED. TimecodeBurninSettings (dict) --- Configures the timecode burn-in feature. If you enable this feature, the timecode will become part of the video. Prefix (string) --- Create a timecode burn-in prefix (optional) Bitrate (integer) --- Average bitrate in bits/second. Required when the rate control mode is CBR. RateControlMode (string) --- Rate control mode. Height (integer) --- Output video height, in pixels. Must be an even number. For most codecs, you can leave this field and width blank in order to use the height and width (resolution) from the source. Note, however, that leaving blank is not recommended. For the Frame Capture codec, height and width are required. RespondToAfd (string) --- Indicates how MediaLive will respond to the AFD values that might be in the input video. If you do not know what AFD signaling is, or if your downstream system has not given you guidance, choose PASSTHROUGH. RESPOND: MediaLive clips the input video using a formula that uses the AFD values (configured in afdSignaling ), the input display aspect ratio, and the output display aspect ratio. MediaLive also includes the AFD values in the output, unless the codec for this encode is FRAME_CAPTURE. PASSTHROUGH: MediaLive ignores the AFD values and does not clip the video. But MediaLive does include the values in the output. NONE: MediaLive does not clip the input video and does not include the AFD values in the output ScalingBehavior (string) --- STRETCH_TO_OUTPUT configures the output position to stretch the video to the specified output resolution (height and width). This option will override any position value. DEFAULT may insert black boxes (pillar boxes or letter boxes) around the video to provide the specified output resolution. Sharpness (integer) --- Changes the strength of the anti-alias filter used for scaling. 0 is the softest setting, 100 is the sharpest. A setting of 50 is recommended for most content. Width (integer) --- Output video width, in pixels. For most codecs, you can leave this field and height blank in order to use the height and width (resolution) from the source. ThumbnailConfiguration (dict) --- Thumbnail configuration settings. ColorCorrectionSettings (dict) --- Color Correction Settings (dict) --- Property of ColorCorrectionSettings. Used for custom color space conversion. The object identifies one 3D LUT file and specifies the input/output color space combination that the file will be used for.",

      "description": "List of input attachments for channel. (dict) --- Placeholder documentation for InputAttachment AutomaticInputFailoverSettings (dict) --- User-specified settings for defining what the conditions are for declaring the input unhealthy and failing over to a different input. ErrorClearTimeMsec (integer) --- This clear time defines the requirement a recovered input must meet to be considered healthy. The input must have no failover conditions for this length of time. Enter a time in milliseconds. This value is particularly important if the input_preference for the failover pair is set to PRIMARY_INPUT_PREFERRED, because after this time, MediaLive will switch back to the primary input. FailoverConditions (list) --- A list of failover conditions. If any of these conditions occur, MediaLive will perform a failover to the other input. (dict) --- Failover Condition settings. There can be multiple failover conditions inside AutomaticInputFailoverSettings. FailoverConditionSettings (dict) --- Failover condition type-specific settings. AudioSilenceSettings (dict) --- MediaLive will perform a failover if the specified audio selector is silent for the specified period. AudioSilenceThresholdMsec (integer) --- The amount of time (in milliseconds) that the active input must be silent before automatic input failover occurs. Silence is defined as audio loss or audio quieter than -50 dBFS. InputLossSettings (dict) --- MediaLive will perform a failover if content is not detected in this input for the specified period. InputLossThresholdMsec (integer) --- The amount of time (in milliseconds) that no input is detected. After that time, an input failover will occur. VideoBlackSettings (dict) --- MediaLive will perform a failover if content is considered black for the specified period. BlackDetectThreshold (float) --- A value used in calculating the threshold below which MediaLive considers a pixel to be --\u0098black'. For the input to be considered black, every pixel in a frame must be below this threshold. The threshold is calculated as a percentage (expressed as a decimal) of white. Therefore .1 means 10% white (or 90% black). Note how the formula works for any color depth. For example, if you set this field to 0.1 in 10-bit color depth: (1023*0.1=102.3), which means a pixel value of 102 or less is --\u0098black'. If you set this field to .1 in an 8-bit color depth: (255*0.1=25.5), which means a pixel value of 25 or less is --\u0098black'. The range is 0.0 to 1.0, with any number of decimal places. VideoBlackThresholdMsec (integer) --- The amount of time (in milliseconds) that the active input must be black before automatic input failover occurs. InputPreference (string) --- Input preference when deciding which input to make active when a previously failed input has recovered.

AudioHlsRenditionSelection (dict) --- Audio Hls Rendition Selection AudioLanguageSelection (dict) --- Audio Language Selection LanguageSelectionPolicy (string) --- When set to 'strict', the transport stream demux strictly identifies audio streams by their language descriptor. If a PMT update occurs such that an audio stream matching the initially selected language is no longer present then mute will be encoded until the language returns. If 'loose', then on a PMT update the demux will choose another audio stream in the program with the same stream type if it can't find one with the same language. AudioPidSelection (dict) --- Audio Pid Selection AudioTrackSelection (dict) --- Audio Track Selection (dict) --- Audio Track DolbyEDecode (dict) --- Configure decoding options for Dolby E streams - these should be Dolby E frames carried in PCM streams tagged with SMPTE-337 CaptionSelectors (list) --- Used to select the caption input to use for inputs that have multiple available. (dict) --- Caption Selector LanguageCode (string) --- When specified this field indicates the three letter language code of the caption track to extract from the source. SelectorSettings (dict) --- Caption selector settings. AncillarySourceSettings (dict) --- Ancillary Source Settings SourceAncillaryChannelNumber (integer) --- Specifies the number (1 to 4) of the captions channel you want to extract from the ancillary captions. If you plan to convert the ancillary captions to another format, complete this field. If you plan to choose Embedded as the captions destination in the output (to pass through all the channels in the ancillary captions), leave this field blank because MediaLive ignores the field. AribSourceSettings (dict) --- Arib Source Settings DvbSubSourceSettings (dict) --- Dvb Sub Source Settings OcrLanguage (string) --- If you will configure a WebVTT caption description that references this caption selector, use this field to provide the language to consider when translating the image-based source to text. Pid (integer) --- When using DVB-Sub with Burn-In or SMPTE-TT, use this PID for the source content. Unused for DVB-Sub passthrough. All DVB-Sub content is passed through, regardless of selectors. EmbeddedSourceSettings (dict) --- Embedded Source Settings Convert608To708 (string) --- If upconvert, 608 data is both passed through via the '608 compatibility bytes' fields of the 708 wrapper as well as translated into 708. 708 data present in the source content will be discarded. Scte20Detection (string) --- Set to 'auto' to handle streams with intermittent and/or non-aligned SCTE-20 and Embedded captions. Source608ChannelNumber (integer) --- Specifies the 608/708 channel number within the video track from which to extract captions. Unused for passthrough. Source608TrackNumber (integer) --- This field is unused and deprecated. Scte20SourceSettings (dict) --- Scte20 Source Settings Convert608To708 (string) --- If upconvert, 608 data is both passed through via the '608 compatibility bytes' fields of the 708 wrapper as well as translated into 708. Scte27SourceSettings (dict) --- Scte27 Source Settings OcrLanguage (string) --- If you will configure a WebVTT caption description that references this caption selector, use this field to provide the language to consider when translating the image-based source to text. Pid (integer) --- The pid field is used in conjunction with the caption selector languageCode field as follows: - Specify PID and Language: Extracts captions from that PID; the language is 'informational'. - Specify PID and omit Language: Extracts the specified PID. - Omit PID and specify Language: Extracts the specified language, whichever PID that happens to be. - Omit PID and omit Language: Valid only if source is DVB-Sub that is being passed through; all languages will be passed through. TeletextSourceSettings (dict) --- Teletext Source Settings OutputRectangle (dict) --- Optionally defines a region where TTML style captions will be displayed PageNumber (string) --- Specifies the teletext page number within the data stream from which to extract captions. Range of 0x100 (256) to 0x8FF (2303). Should be specified as a hexadecimal string with no '0x' prefix. DeblockFilter (string) --- Enable or disable the deblock filter when filtering. DenoiseFilter (string) --- Enable or disable the denoise filter when filtering. FilterStrength (integer) --- Adjusts the magnitude of filtering from 1 (minimal) to 5 (strongest). InputFilter (string) --- Turns on the filter for this input. MPEG-2 inputs have the deblocking filter enabled by default. 1) auto - filtering will be applied depending on input type/quality 2) disabled - no filtering will be applied to the input 3) forced - filtering will be applied regardless of input type NetworkInputSettings (dict) --- Input settings. HlsInputSettings (dict) --- Specifies HLS input settings when the uri is for a HLS manifest. Bandwidth (integer) --- When specified the HLS stream with the m3u8 BANDWIDTH that most closely matches this value will be chosen, otherwise the highest bandwidth stream in the m3u8 will be chosen. The bitrate is specified in bits per second, as in an HLS manifest. BufferSegments (integer) --- When specified, reading of the HLS input will begin this many buffer segments from the end (most recently written segment). When not specified, the HLS input will begin with the first segment specified in the m3u8. Retries (integer) --- The number of consecutive times that attempts to read a manifest or segment must fail before the input is considered unavailable. RetryInterval (integer) --- The number of seconds between retries when an attempt to read a manifest or segment fails. Scte35Source (string) --- Identifies the source for the SCTE-35 messages that MediaLive will ingest. Messages can be ingested from the content segments (in the stream) or from tags in the playlist (the HLS manifest). MediaLive ignores SCTE-35 information in the source that is not selected. ServerValidation (string) --- Check HTTPS server certificates. When set to checkCryptographyOnly, cryptography in the certificate will be checked, but not the server's name. Certain subdomains (notably S3 buckets that use dots in the bucket name) do not strictly match the corresponding certificate's wildcard pattern and would otherwise cause the event to error. This setting is ignored for protocols that do not use https. MulticastInputSettings (dict) --- Specifies multicast input settings when the uri is for a multicast event. SourceIpAddress (string) --- Optionally, a source ip address to filter by for Source-specific Multicast (SSM) Scte35Pid (integer) --- PID from which to read SCTE-35 messages. If left undefined, EML will select the first SCTE-35 PID found in the input. Smpte2038DataPreference (string) --- Specifies whether to extract applicable ancillary data from a SMPTE-2038 source in this input. Applicable data types are captions, timecode, AFD, and SCTE-104 messages. - PREFER: Extract from SMPTE-2038 if present in this input, otherwise extract from another source (if any). - IGNORE: Never extract any ancillary data from SMPTE-2038. SourceEndBehavior (string) --- Loop input if it is a file. This allows a file input to be streamed indefinitely. VideoSelector (dict) --- Informs which video elementary stream to decode for input types that have multiple available. ColorSpace (string) --- Specifies the color space of an input. This setting works in tandem with colorSpaceUsage and a video description's colorSpaceSettingsChoice to determine if any conversion will be performed. ColorSpaceSettings (dict) --- Color space settings Hdr10Settings (dict) --- Hdr10 Settings MaxCll (integer) --- Maximum Content Light Level An integer metadata value defining the maximum light level, in nits, of any single pixel within an encoded HDR video stream or file. MaxFall (integer) --- Maximum Frame Average Light Level An integer metadata value defining the maximum average light level, in nits, for any single frame within an encoded HDR video stream or file. ColorSpaceUsage (string) --- Applies only if colorSpace is a value other than follow. This field controls how the value in the colorSpace field will be used. fallback means that when the input does include color space data, that data will be used, but when the input has no color space data, the value in colorSpace will be used. Choose fallback if your input is sometimes missing color space data, but when it does have color space data, that data is correct. force means to always use the value in colorSpace. Choose force if your input usually has no color space data or might have unreliable color space data. SelectorSettings (dict) --- The video selector settings. VideoSelectorPid (dict) --- Video Selector Pid Pid (integer) --- Selects a specific PID from within a video source. VideoSelectorProgramId (dict) --- Video Selector Program Id ProgramId (integer) --- Selects a specific program from within a multi-program transport stream. If the program doesn't exist, the first program within the transport stream will be selected by default. LogicalInterfaceNames (list) --- Optional assignment of an input to a logical interface on the Node. Only applies to on premises channels. (string) --- Placeholder documentation for __string.",
