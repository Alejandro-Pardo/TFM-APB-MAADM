For video, JPEG XS streams, set the encoding name to jxsv. EncodingParameters (dict) --- A collection of parameters that determine how MediaConnect will convert the content. These fields only apply to outputs on flows that have a CDI source. A value that is used to calculate compression for an output. The bitrate of the output is calculated as follows: Output bitrate = (1 / compressionFactor) * (source bitrate) This property only applies to outputs that use the ST 2110 JPEG XS protocol, with a flow source that uses the CDI protocol. Valid values are floating point numbers in the range of 3.0 to 10.0, inclusive. A setting on the encoder that drives compression settings.

VpcInterfaceName (string) --- The name of the VPC interface to use for this resource. OutputStatus (string) --- An indication of whether the new output should be enabled or disabled as soon as it is created. If you don't specify the outputStatus field in your request, MediaConnect sets it to ENABLED. NdiSpeedHqQuality (integer) --- A quality setting for the NDI Speed HQ encoder. NdiProgramName (string) --- A suffix for the names of the NDI sources that the flow creates. If a custom name isn't specified, MediaConnect uses the output name.",
