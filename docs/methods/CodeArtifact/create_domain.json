  "description": "Creates a domain. CodeArtifact domains make it easier to manage multiple repositories across an organization. You can use a domain to apply permissions across many repositories owned by different Amazon Web Services accounts. An asset is stored only once in a domain, even if it's in multiple repositories. Although you can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production domain that contains all published artifacts so that your development teams can find and share packages. You can use a second pre-production domain to test changes to the production domain configuration.",
