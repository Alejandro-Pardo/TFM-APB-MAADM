  "description": "Sets the package origin configuration for a package. The package origin configuration determines how new versions of a package can be added to a repository. You can allow or block direct publishing of new package versions, or ingestion and retaining of new package versions from an external connection or upstream source. For more information about package origin controls and configuration, see Editing package origin controls in the CodeArtifact User Guide. PutPackageOriginConfiguration can be called on a package that doesn't yet exist in the repository. When called on a package that does not exist, a package is created in the repository with no versions and the requested restrictions are set on the package. This can be used to preemptively block ingesting or retaining any versions from external connections or upstream repositories, or to block publishing any versions of the package into the repository before connecting any package managers or publishers to the repository.",
