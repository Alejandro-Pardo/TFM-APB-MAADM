If you specify more than one condition, Amazon Macie uses AND logic to join the conditions.

Valid values are EQ (equals) and NE (not equals). key (string) --- The property to use in the condition. values (list) --- An array that lists one or more values to use in the condition. If you specify multiple values, Amazon Macie uses OR logic to join the values. Valid values for each supported property (key) are: ACCOUNT_ID - A string that represents the unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket. S3_BUCKET_EFFECTIVE_PERMISSION - A string that represents an enumerated value that Macie defines for the BucketPublicAccess.effectivePermission property of a bucket. S3_BUCKET_NAME - A string that represents the name of a bucket.

Tag keys and values are case sensitive. Also, Amazon Macie doesn't support use of partial values or wildcard characters in tag-based conditions. key (string) --- The value for the tag key to use in the condition. value (string) --- The tag value to use in the condition. includes (dict) --- The property- and tag-based conditions that determine which buckets to include in the job. bucketDefinitions (list) --- An array of objects, one for each Amazon Web Services account that owns specific S3 buckets to analyze. Each object specifies the account ID for an account and one or more buckets to analyze for that account. A job's definition can contain a bucketDefinitions array or a bucketCriteria object, not both. (dict) --- Specifies an Amazon Web Services account that owns S3 buckets for a classification job to analyze, and one or more specific buckets to analyze for that account. The unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account that owns the buckets. An array that lists the names of the buckets.

If the value for the key property is OBJECT_EXTENSION or OBJECT_KEY, this array can specify multiple values and Amazon Macie uses OR logic to join the values. Otherwise, this array can specify only one value. Valid values for each supported property (key) are: OBJECT_EXTENSION - A string that represents the file name extension of an object. For example: docx or pdf OBJECT_KEY - A string that represents the key prefix (folder name or path) of an object. For example: logs or awslogs/eventlogs. This value applies a condition to objects whose keys (names) begin with the specified value. OBJECT_LAST_MODIFIED_DATE - The date and time (in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format) when an object was created or last changed, whichever is latest. For example: 2023-09-24T14:31:13Z OBJECT_SIZE - An integer that represents the storage size (in bytes) of an object. Macie doesn't support use of wildcard characters in these values. Also, string values are case sensitive.

Valid values are EQ (equals) or NE (not equals). key (string) --- The object property to use in the condition. The only valid value is TAG. tagValues (list) --- The tag keys or tag key and value pairs to use in the condition. To specify only tag keys in a condition, specify the keys in this array and set the value for each associated tag value to an empty string.

To specify only a tag key for a condition, specify the tag key for the key property and set this value to an empty string. target (string) --- The type of object to apply the condition to. includes (dict) --- The property- and tag-based conditions that determine which objects to include in the analysis. target (string) --- The type of object to apply the condition to.",
