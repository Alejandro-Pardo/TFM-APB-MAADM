If you want to authenticate identities using an identity provider, you can create an identity provider configuration and associate it to your cluster. After configuring authentication to your cluster you can create Kubernetes Role and ClusterRole objects, assign permissions to them, and then bind them to the identities using Kubernetes RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding objects. For more information see Using RBAC Authorization in the Kubernetes documentation.",

Typically the URL consists of only a hostname, like https://server.example.org or https://example.com. This URL should point to the level below .well-known/openid-configuration and must be publicly accessible over the internet. This is also known as audience. The ID for the client application that makes authentication requests to the OIDC identity provider. usernameClaim (string) --- The JSON Web Token (JWT) claim to use as the username. The default is sub, which is expected to be a unique identifier of the end user. You can choose other claims, such as email or name, depending on the OIDC identity provider. Claims other than email are prefixed with the issuer URL to prevent naming clashes with other plug-ins. usernamePrefix (string) --- The prefix that is prepended to username claims to prevent clashes with existing names. If you do not provide this field, and username is a value other than email, the prefix defaults to issuerurl#.

For example, the value `` oidc:`` will create group names like oidc:engineering and oidc:infra. requiredClaims (dict) --- The key value pairs that describe required claims in the identity token.
