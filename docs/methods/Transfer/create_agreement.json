  "description": "Creates an agreement. An agreement is a bilateral trading partner agreement, or partnership, between an Transfer Family server and an AS2 process. The agreement defines the file and message transfer relationship between the server and the AS2 process. To define an agreement, Transfer Family combines a server, local profile, partner profile, certificate, and other attributes. The partner is identified with the PartnerProfileId, and the AS2 process is identified with the LocalProfileId.",

For the access role, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management role to use. With AS2, you can send files by calling StartFileTransfer and specifying the file paths in the request parameter, SendFilePaths. We use the file's parent directory (for example, for --send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt, parent directory is /bucket/dir/) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the AccessRole needs to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the file location used in the StartFileTransfer request. Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the files that you intend to send with StartFileTransfer. If you are using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key instead of the Amazon Web Services managed key in Secrets Manager, then the role also needs the kms:Decrypt permission for that key. Make sure that the access role provides read and write access to the parent directory of the file location that's used in the StartFileTransfer request. Additionally, make sure that the role provides secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission to Secrets Manager.",
