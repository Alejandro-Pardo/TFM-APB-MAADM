  "description": "Assigns new properties to a user. Parameters you pass modify any or all of the following: the home directory, role, and policy for the UserName and ServerId you specify. The response returns the ServerId and the UserName for the updated user. In the console, you can select Restricted when you create or update a user. This ensures that the user can't access anything outside of their home directory. The programmatic way to configure this behavior is to update the user. Set their HomeDirectoryType to LOGICAL, and specify HomeDirectoryMappings with Entry as root ( /) and Target as their home directory. For example, if the user's home directory is /test/admin-user, the following command updates the user so that their configuration in the console shows the Restricted flag as selected. aws transfer update-user --server-id <server-id> --user-name admin-user --home-directory-type LOGICAL --home-directory-mappings \"[{\\\"Entry\\\":\\\"/\\\", \\\"Target\\\":\\\"/test/admin-user\\\"}]\"",

The following is an Entry and Target pair example.
