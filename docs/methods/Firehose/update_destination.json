  "description": "Updates the specified destination of the specified Firehose stream. Use this operation to change the destination type (for example, to replace the Amazon S3 destination with Amazon Redshift) or change the parameters associated with a destination (for example, to change the bucket name of the Amazon S3 destination). The update might not occur immediately. The target Firehose stream remains active while the configurations are updated, so data writes to the Firehose stream can continue during this process. The updated configurations are usually effective within a few minutes. Switching between Amazon OpenSearch Service and other services is not supported. For an Amazon OpenSearch Service destination, you can only update to another Amazon OpenSearch Service destination. If the destination type is the same, Firehose merges the configuration parameters specified with the destination configuration that already exists on the delivery stream. If any of the parameters are not specified in the call, the existing values are retained. For example, in the Amazon S3 destination, if  EncryptionConfiguration is not specified, then the existing EncryptionConfiguration is maintained on the destination. If the destination type is not the same, for example, changing the destination from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift, Firehose does not merge any parameters. In this case, all parameters must be specified. Firehose uses CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId to avoid race conditions and conflicting merges. This is a required field, and the service updates the configuration only if the existing configuration has a version ID that matches. After the update is applied successfully, the version ID is updated, and can be retrieved using  DescribeDeliveryStream. Use the new version ID to set CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId in the next call.",

(dict) --- Describes a data processor. The type of processor. Parameters (list) --- The processor parameters. (dict) --- Describes the processor parameter. The name of the parameter. Currently the following default values are supported: 3 for NumberOfRetries and 60 for the BufferIntervalInSeconds. The BufferSizeInMBs ranges between 0.2 MB and up to 3MB. The default buffering hint is 1MB for all destinations, except Splunk. For Splunk, the default buffering hint is 256 KB. The parameter value. S3BackupMode (string) --- You can update a Firehose stream to enable Amazon S3 backup if it is disabled. If backup is enabled, you can't update the Firehose stream to disable it. S3BackupUpdate (dict) --- The Amazon S3 destination for backup. If no value is specified, BufferingHints object default values are used. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not supported by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. DataFormatConversionConfiguration (dict) --- The serializer, deserializer, and schema for converting data from the JSON format to the Parquet or ORC format before writing it to Amazon S3. SchemaConfiguration (dict) --- Specifies the Amazon Web Services Glue Data Catalog table that contains the column information. This parameter is required if Enabled is set to true. RoleARN (string) --- The role that Firehose can use to access Amazon Web Services Glue. This role must be in the same account you use for Firehose. Cross-account roles aren't allowed. CatalogId (string) --- The ID of the Amazon Web Services Glue Data Catalog. If you don't supply this, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by default. DatabaseName (string) --- Specifies the name of the Amazon Web Services Glue database that contains the schema for the output data. TableName (string) --- Specifies the Amazon Web Services Glue table that contains the column information that constitutes your data schema. Region (string) --- If you don't specify an Amazon Web Services Region, the default is the current Region. VersionId (string) --- Specifies the table version for the output data schema. If you don't specify this version ID, or if you set it to LATEST, Firehose uses the most recent version. This means that any updates to the table are automatically picked up. InputFormatConfiguration (dict) --- Specifies the deserializer that you want Firehose to use to convert the format of your data from JSON. Deserializer (dict) --- Specifies which deserializer to use. You can choose either the Apache Hive JSON SerDe or the OpenX JSON SerDe. If both are non-null, the server rejects the request. OpenXJsonSerDe (dict) --- The OpenX SerDe. Used by Firehose for deserializing data, which means converting it from the JSON format in preparation for serializing it to the Parquet or ORC format. This is one of two deserializers you can choose, depending on which one offers the functionality you need. The other option is the native Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe. ConvertDotsInJsonKeysToUnderscores (boolean) --- When set to true, specifies that the names of the keys include dots and that you want Firehose to replace them with underscores. This is useful because Apache Hive does not allow dots in column names. For example, if the JSON contains a key whose name is 'a.b', you can define the column name to be 'a_b' when using this option. The default is false. CaseInsensitive (boolean) --- When set to true, which is the default, Firehose converts JSON keys to lowercase before deserializing them. ColumnToJsonKeyMappings (dict) --- Maps column names to JSON keys that aren't identical to the column names. This is useful when the JSON contains keys that are Hive keywords. For example, timestamp is a Hive keyword. If you have a JSON key named timestamp, set this parameter to {\"ts\": \"timestamp\"} to map this key to a column named ts. (string) --- (string) --- HiveJsonSerDe (dict) --- The native Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe. The other option is the OpenX SerDe. TimestampFormats (list) --- Indicates how you want Firehose to parse the date and timestamps that may be present in your input data JSON. To specify these format strings, follow the pattern syntax of JodaTime's DateTimeFormat format strings. For more information, see Class DateTimeFormat. You can also use the special value millis to parse timestamps in epoch milliseconds. If you don't specify a format, Firehose uses java.sql.Timestamp::valueOf by default. (string) --- OutputFormatConfiguration (dict) --- Specifies the serializer that you want Firehose to use to convert the format of your data to the Parquet or ORC format. Serializer (dict) --- Specifies which serializer to use. You can choose either the ORC SerDe or the Parquet SerDe. ParquetSerDe (dict) --- A serializer to use for converting data to the Parquet format before storing it in Amazon S3. For more information, see Apache Parquet. BlockSizeBytes (integer) --- The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) block size. This is useful if you intend to copy the data from Amazon S3 to HDFS before querying. The default is 256 MiB and the minimum is 64 MiB. Firehose uses this value for padding calculations. PageSizeBytes (integer) --- The Parquet page size. Column chunks are divided into pages. A page is conceptually an indivisible unit (in terms of compression and encoding). The minimum value is 64 KiB and the default is 1 MiB. Compression (string) --- The compression code to use over data blocks. The possible values are UNCOMPRESSED, SNAPPY, and GZIP, with the default being SNAPPY. Use SNAPPY for higher decompression speed. Use GZIP if the compression ratio is more important than speed. EnableDictionaryCompression (boolean) --- Indicates whether to enable dictionary compression. MaxPaddingBytes (integer) --- The maximum amount of padding to apply. The default is 0. WriterVersion (string) --- Indicates the version of row format to output. The possible values are V1 and V2. The default is V1. OrcSerDe (dict) --- A serializer to use for converting data to the ORC format before storing it in Amazon S3. For more information, see Apache ORC. StripeSizeBytes (integer) --- The number of bytes in each stripe. The default is 64 MiB and the minimum is 8 MiB. RowIndexStride (integer) --- The number of rows between index entries. The default is 10,000 and the minimum is 1,000. EnablePadding (boolean) --- Set this to true to indicate that you want stripes to be padded to the HDFS block boundaries. PaddingTolerance (float) --- A number between 0 and 1 that defines the tolerance for block padding as a decimal fraction of stripe size. The default value is 0.05, which means 5 percent of stripe size. For the default values of 64 MiB ORC stripes and 256 MiB HDFS blocks, the default block padding tolerance of 5 percent reserves a maximum of 3.2 MiB for padding within the 256 MiB block. In such a case, if the available size within the block is more than 3.2 MiB, a new, smaller stripe is inserted to fit within that space. This ensures that no stripe crosses block boundaries and causes remote reads within a node-local task. Firehose ignores this parameter when  OrcSerDe$EnablePadding is false. The default is SNAPPY. BloomFilterColumns (list) --- The column names for which you want Firehose to create bloom filters. The default is null. (string) --- BloomFilterFalsePositiveProbability (float) --- The Bloom filter false positive probability (FPP). The lower the FPP, the bigger the Bloom filter. The default value is 0.05, the minimum is 0, and the maximum is 1. DictionaryKeyThreshold (float) --- Represents the fraction of the total number of non-null rows. To turn off dictionary encoding, set this fraction to a number that is less than the number of distinct keys in a dictionary. To always use dictionary encoding, set this threshold to 1. FormatVersion (string) --- The version of the file to write. The possible values are V0_11 and V0_12. The default is V0_12. Enabled (boolean) --- Defaults to true. Set it to false if you want to disable format conversion while preserving the configuration details. DynamicPartitioningConfiguration (dict) --- The configuration of the dynamic partitioning mechanism that creates smaller data sets from the streaming data by partitioning it based on partition keys. Currently, dynamic partitioning is only supported for Amazon S3 destinations. RetryOptions (dict) --- The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver data to an Amazon S3 prefix. DurationInSeconds (integer) --- The period of time during which Firehose retries to deliver data to the specified destination. Enabled (boolean) --- Specifies that the dynamic partitioning is enabled for this Firehose stream. FileExtension (string) --- Specify a file extension. It will override the default file extension CustomTimeZone (string) --- The time zone you prefer. UTC is the default.",

For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces. ClusterJDBCURL (string) --- The database connection string. CopyCommand (dict) --- The COPY command. The name of the target table. The table must already exist in the database. DataTableColumns (string) --- A comma-separated list of column names. CopyOptions (string) --- Optional parameters to use with the Amazon Redshift COPY command. For more information, see the 'Optional Parameters' section of Amazon Redshift COPY command. Some possible examples that would apply to Firehose are as follows: delimiter '\\t' lzop; - fields are delimited with 't' (TAB character) and compressed using lzop. delimiter '|' - fields are delimited with '|' (this is the default delimiter). delimiter '|' escape - the delimiter should be escaped. fixedwidth 'venueid:3,venuename:25,venuecity:12,venuestate:2,venueseats:6' - fields are fixed width in the source, with each width specified after every column in the table. JSON 's3://mybucket/jsonpaths.txt' - data is in JSON format, and the path specified is the format of the data. For more examples, see Amazon Redshift COPY command examples. Username (string) --- The name of the user. Password (string) --- The user password. RetryOptions (dict) --- The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver documents to Amazon Redshift. Default value is 3600 (60 minutes). DurationInSeconds (integer) --- The length of time during which Firehose retries delivery after a failure, starting from the initial request and including the first attempt. The default value is 3600 seconds (60 minutes). Firehose does not retry if the value of DurationInSeconds is 0 (zero) or if the first delivery attempt takes longer than the current value. S3Update (dict) --- The Amazon S3 destination. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified in RedshiftDestinationUpdate.S3Update because the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket doesn't support these compression formats. BucketARN (string) --- The ARN of the S3 bucket. Prefix (string) --- The 'YYYY/MM/DD/HH' time format prefix is automatically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. ErrorOutputPrefix (string) --- A prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears immediately following the bucket name. For information about how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering option. If no value is specified, BufferingHints object default values are used. SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds, and vice versa. We recommend setting this parameter to a value greater than the amount of data you typically ingest into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher. IntervalInSeconds (integer) --- Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for SizeInMBs, and vice versa. CompressionFormat (string) --- The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is UNCOMPRESSED. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not supported by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket. EncryptionConfiguration (dict) --- The encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the default is no encryption. NoEncryptionConfig (string) --- Specifically override existing encryption information to ensure that no encryption is used. KMSEncryptionConfig (dict) --- The encryption key. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key. Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables CloudWatch logging. LogGroupName (string) --- The CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is required if CloudWatch logging is enabled. LogStreamName (string) --- The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. ProcessingConfiguration (dict) --- The data processing configuration. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables data processing. Processors (list) --- The data processors. (dict) --- Describes a data processor. The type of processor. Parameters (list) --- The processor parameters. (dict) --- Describes the processor parameter. The name of the parameter. Currently the following default values are supported: 3 for NumberOfRetries and 60 for the BufferIntervalInSeconds. The BufferSizeInMBs ranges between 0.2 MB and up to 3MB. The default buffering hint is 1MB for all destinations, except Splunk. For Splunk, the default buffering hint is 256 KB. The parameter value. S3BackupMode (string) --- You can update a Firehose stream to enable Amazon S3 backup if it is disabled. If backup is enabled, you can't update the Firehose stream to disable it. S3BackupUpdate (dict) --- The Amazon S3 destination for backup. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The Amazon CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. SecretsManagerConfiguration (dict) --- The configuration that defines how you access secrets for Amazon Redshift. SecretARN (string) --- The ARN of the secret that stores your credentials. It must be in the same region as the Firehose stream and the role. The secret ARN can reside in a different account than the Firehose stream and role as Firehose supports cross-account secret access. This parameter is required when Enabled is set to True. RoleARN (string) --- Specifies the role that Firehose assumes when calling the Secrets Manager API operation. When you provide the role, it overrides any destination specific role defined in the destination configuration. If you do not provide the then we use the destination specific role. This parameter is required for Splunk. Specifies whether you want to use the secrets manager feature. When set as True the secrets manager configuration overwrites the existing secrets in the destination configuration. When it's set to False Firehose falls back to the credentials in the destination configuration.",

      "description": "Describes an update for a destination in Amazon OpenSearch Service. RoleARN (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be assumed by Firehose for calling the Amazon OpenSearch Service Configuration API and for indexing documents. For more information, see Grant Firehose Access to an Amazon S3 Destination and Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces. DomainARN (string) --- The ARN of the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain. The IAM role must have permissions for\u00c2\u00a0 DescribeDomain, DescribeDomains, and DescribeDomainConfig\u00c2\u00a0after assuming the IAM role specified in RoleARN. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces. Specify either ClusterEndpoint or DomainARN. ClusterEndpoint (string) --- The endpoint to use when communicating with the cluster. Specify either this ClusterEndpoint or the DomainARN field. IndexName (string) --- The Elasticsearch index name. TypeName (string) --- The Elasticsearch type name. For Elasticsearch 6.x, there can be only one type per index. If you try to specify a new type for an existing index that already has another type, Firehose returns an error during runtime. If you upgrade Elasticsearch from 6.x to 7.x and don't update your Firehose stream, Firehose still delivers data to Elasticsearch with the old index name and type name. If you want to update your Firehose stream with a new index name, provide an empty string for TypeName. IndexRotationPeriod (string) --- The Elasticsearch index rotation period. Index rotation appends a timestamp to IndexName to facilitate the expiration of old data. For more information, see Index Rotation for the Amazon OpenSearch Service Destination. Default value is\u00c2\u00a0 OneDay. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering options. If no value is specified, ElasticsearchBufferingHints object default values are used. IntervalInSeconds (integer) --- Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 300 (5 minutes). SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MBs, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5. We recommend setting this parameter to a value greater than the amount of data you typically ingest into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MB/sec, the value should be 10 MB or higher. RetryOptions (dict) --- The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver documents to Amazon OpenSearch Service. DurationInSeconds (integer) --- After an initial failure to deliver to Amazon OpenSearch Service, the total amount of time during which Firehose retries delivery (including the first attempt). After this time has elapsed, the failed documents are written to Amazon S3. Default value is 300 seconds (5 minutes). A value of 0 (zero) results in no retries. S3Update (dict) --- The Amazon S3 destination. RoleARN (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services credentials. BucketARN (string) --- The ARN of the S3 bucket. Prefix (string) --- The 'YYYY/MM/DD/HH' time format prefix is automatically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. ErrorOutputPrefix (string) --- A prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears immediately following the bucket name. For information about how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering option. If no value is specified, BufferingHints object default values are used. SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, before delivering it to the destination. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds, and vice versa. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher. The default value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for SizeInMBs, and vice versa. CompressionFormat (string) --- The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is UNCOMPRESSED. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not supported by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket. EncryptionConfiguration (dict) --- The encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the default is no encryption. NoEncryptionConfig (string) --- Specifically override existing encryption information to ensure that no encryption is used. KMSEncryptionConfig (dict) --- The encryption key. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key. Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables CloudWatch logging. LogGroupName (string) --- The CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is required if CloudWatch logging is enabled. LogStreamName (string) --- The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. ProcessingConfiguration (dict) --- The data processing configuration. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables data processing. Processors (list) --- The data processors. (dict) --- Describes a data processor. The type of processor. Parameters (list) --- The processor parameters. (dict) --- Describes the processor parameter. The name of the parameter. Currently the following default values are supported: 3 for NumberOfRetries and 60 for the BufferIntervalInSeconds. The BufferSizeInMBs ranges between 0.2 MB and up to 3MB. The default buffering hint is 1MB for all destinations, except Splunk. For Splunk, the default buffering hint is 256 KB. The parameter value. DocumentIdOptions (dict) --- Indicates the method for setting up document ID. The supported methods are Firehose generated document ID and OpenSearch Service generated document ID. When the FIREHOSE_DEFAULT option is chosen, Firehose generates a unique document ID for each record based on a unique internal identifier. The generated document ID is stable across multiple delivery attempts, which helps prevent the same record from being indexed multiple times with different document IDs. When the NO_DOCUMENT_ID option is chosen, Firehose does not include any document IDs in the requests it sends to the Amazon OpenSearch Service. This causes the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain to generate document IDs. In case of multiple delivery attempts, this may cause the same record to be indexed more than once with different document IDs. This option enables write-heavy operations, such as the ingestion of logs and observability data, to consume less resources in the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain, resulting in improved performance.",

RoleARN (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be assumed by Firehose for calling the Amazon OpenSearch Service Configuration API and for indexing documents. DomainARN (string) --- The ARN of the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain. The IAM role must have permissions for DescribeDomain, DescribeDomains, and DescribeDomainConfig after assuming the IAM role specified in RoleARN. ClusterEndpoint (string) --- The endpoint to use when communicating with the cluster. Specify either this ClusterEndpoint or the DomainARN field. IndexName (string) --- The Amazon OpenSearch Service index name. TypeName (string) --- The Amazon OpenSearch Service type name. For Elasticsearch 6.x, there can be only one type per index. If you try to specify a new type for an existing index that already has another type, Firehose returns an error during runtime. If you upgrade Elasticsearch from 6.x to 7.x and don't update your Firehose stream, Firehose still delivers data to Elasticsearch with the old index name and type name. If you want to update your Firehose stream with a new index name, provide an empty string for TypeName. IndexRotationPeriod (string) --- The Amazon OpenSearch Service index rotation period. Index rotation appends a timestamp to IndexName to facilitate the expiration of old data. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering options. If no value is specified, AmazonopensearchBufferingHints object default values are used. IntervalInSeconds (integer) --- Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 300 (5 minutes). SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MBs, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5. We recommend setting this parameter to a value greater than the amount of data you typically ingest into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MB/sec, the value should be 10 MB or higher. RetryOptions (dict) --- The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver documents to Amazon OpenSearch Service. DurationInSeconds (integer) --- After an initial failure to deliver to Amazon OpenSearch Service, the total amount of time during which Firehose retries delivery (including the first attempt). After this time has elapsed, the failed documents are written to Amazon S3. Default value is 300 seconds (5 minutes). A value of 0 (zero) results in no retries. S3Update (dict) --- Describes an update for a destination in Amazon S3. RoleARN (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services credentials. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces. BucketARN (string) --- The ARN of the S3 bucket. Prefix (string) --- The 'YYYY/MM/DD/HH' time format prefix is automatically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. ErrorOutputPrefix (string) --- A prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears immediately following the bucket name. For information about how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering option. If no value is specified, BufferingHints object default values are used. SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, before delivering it to the destination. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds, and vice versa. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher. The default value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for SizeInMBs, and vice versa. CompressionFormat (string) --- The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is UNCOMPRESSED. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not supported by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket. EncryptionConfiguration (dict) --- The encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the default is no encryption. NoEncryptionConfig (string) --- Specifically override existing encryption information to ensure that no encryption is used. KMSEncryptionConfig (dict) --- The encryption key. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key. Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables CloudWatch logging. LogGroupName (string) --- The CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is required if CloudWatch logging is enabled. LogStreamName (string) --- The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. ProcessingConfiguration (dict) --- Describes a data processing configuration. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables data processing. Processors (list) --- The data processors. (dict) --- Describes a data processor. The type of processor. Parameters (list) --- The processor parameters. (dict) --- Describes the processor parameter. The name of the parameter. Currently the following default values are supported: 3 for NumberOfRetries and 60 for the BufferIntervalInSeconds. The BufferSizeInMBs ranges between 0.2 MB and up to 3MB. The default buffering hint is 1MB for all destinations, except Splunk. For Splunk, the default buffering hint is 256 KB. The parameter value. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- Describes the Amazon CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. DocumentIdOptions (dict) --- Indicates the method for setting up document ID.

HECAcknowledgmentTimeoutInSeconds (integer) --- The amount of time that Firehose waits to receive an acknowledgment from Splunk after it sends data. At the end of the timeout period, Firehose either tries to send the data again or considers it an error, based on your retry settings. RetryOptions (dict) --- The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver data to Splunk or if it doesn't receive an acknowledgment of receipt from Splunk. DurationInSeconds (integer) --- The total amount of time that Firehose spends on retries. This duration starts after the initial attempt to send data to Splunk fails. It doesn't include the periods during which Firehose waits for acknowledgment from Splunk after each attempt. S3BackupMode (string) --- Specifies how you want Firehose to back up documents to Amazon S3. When set to FailedDocumentsOnly, Firehose writes any data that could not be indexed to the configured Amazon S3 destination. When set to AllEvents, Firehose delivers all incoming records to Amazon S3, and also writes failed documents to Amazon S3. The default value is FailedEventsOnly. You can update this backup mode from FailedEventsOnly to AllEvents. You can't update it from AllEvents to FailedEventsOnly. S3Update (dict) --- Your update to the configuration of the backup Amazon S3 location. RoleARN (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services credentials. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces. BucketARN (string) --- The ARN of the S3 bucket. Prefix (string) --- The 'YYYY/MM/DD/HH' time format prefix is automatically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. ErrorOutputPrefix (string) --- A prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears immediately following the bucket name. For information about how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering option.

The default value is 5. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds, and vice versa. We recommend setting this parameter to a value greater than the amount of data you typically ingest into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher. IntervalInSeconds (integer) --- Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for SizeInMBs, and vice versa. CompressionFormat (string) --- The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is UNCOMPRESSED. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not supported by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket. EncryptionConfiguration (dict) --- The encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the default is no encryption. NoEncryptionConfig (string) --- Specifically override existing encryption information to ensure that no encryption is used. KMSEncryptionConfig (dict) --- The encryption key.

CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The Amazon CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering options. If no value is specified, the default values for Splunk are used. The default value is 60 (1 minute). SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MBs, before delivering it to the destination. SecretsManagerConfiguration (dict) --- The configuration that defines how you access secrets for Splunk. SecretARN (string) --- The ARN of the secret that stores your credentials. It must be in the same region as the Firehose stream and the role. The secret ARN can reside in a different account than the Firehose stream and role as Firehose supports cross-account secret access. This parameter is required when Enabled is set to True. RoleARN (string) --- Specifies the role that Firehose assumes when calling the Secrets Manager API operation. When you provide the role, it overrides any destination specific role defined in the destination configuration. If you do not provide the then we use the destination specific role. This parameter is required for Splunk. Specifies whether you want to use the secrets manager feature.

For information about how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering option. If no value is specified, BufferingHints object default values are used. SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, before delivering it to the destination. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds, and vice versa. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher. The default value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for SizeInMBs, and vice versa. CompressionFormat (string) --- The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is UNCOMPRESSED.

SnowflakeRoleConfiguration (dict) --- Optionally configure a Snowflake role. Otherwise the default user role will be used. Enabled (boolean) --- Enable Snowflake role SnowflakeRole (string) --- The Snowflake role you wish to configure DataLoadingOption (string) --- JSON keys mapped to table column names or choose to split the JSON payload where content is mapped to a record content column and source metadata is mapped to a record metadata column. MetaDataColumnName (string) --- The name of the record metadata column ContentColumnName (string) --- The name of the content metadata column CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- Describes the Amazon CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream.

Parameters (list) --- The processor parameters. (dict) --- Describes the processor parameter. The name of the parameter. Currently the following default values are supported: 3 for NumberOfRetries and 60 for the BufferIntervalInSeconds. The BufferSizeInMBs ranges between 0.2 MB and up to 3MB. The default buffering hint is 1MB for all destinations, except Splunk. For Splunk, the default buffering hint is 256 KB. The parameter value. RoleARN (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Snowflake role RetryOptions (dict) --- Specify how long Firehose retries sending data to the New Relic HTTP endpoint. After sending data, Firehose first waits for an acknowledgment from the HTTP endpoint. If an error occurs or the acknowledgment doesn't arrive within the acknowledgment timeout period, Firehose starts the retry duration counter. It keeps retrying until the retry duration expires. After that, Firehose considers it a data delivery failure and backs up the data to your Amazon S3 bucket. Every time that Firehose sends data to the HTTP endpoint (either the initial attempt or a retry), it restarts the acknowledgement timeout counter and waits for an acknowledgement from the HTTP endpoint. Even if the retry duration expires, Firehose still waits for the acknowledgment until it receives it or the acknowledgement timeout period is reached. If the acknowledgment times out, Firehose determines whether there's time left in the retry counter. If there is time left, it retries again and repeats the logic until it receives an acknowledgment or determines that the retry time has expired. If you don't want Firehose to retry sending data, set this value to 0. DurationInSeconds (integer) --- the time period where Firehose will retry sending data to the chosen HTTP endpoint. S3BackupMode (string) --- Choose an S3 backup mode. Once you set the mode as AllData, you can not change it to FailedDataOnly. S3Update (dict) --- Describes an update for a destination in Amazon S3. RoleARN (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services credentials. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces. BucketARN (string) --- The ARN of the S3 bucket. Prefix (string) --- The 'YYYY/MM/DD/HH' time format prefix is automatically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. ErrorOutputPrefix (string) --- A prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears immediately following the bucket name. For information about how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering option. If no value is specified, BufferingHints object default values are used. SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds, and vice versa. We recommend setting this parameter to a value greater than the amount of data you typically ingest into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher. IntervalInSeconds (integer) --- Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for SizeInMBs, and vice versa. CompressionFormat (string) --- The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is UNCOMPRESSED. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not supported by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket. EncryptionConfiguration (dict) --- The encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the default is no encryption. NoEncryptionConfig (string) --- Specifically override existing encryption information to ensure that no encryption is used. KMSEncryptionConfig (dict) --- The encryption key. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key. Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. SecretsManagerConfiguration (dict) --- Describes the Secrets Manager configuration in Snowflake. SecretARN (string) --- The ARN of the secret that stores your credentials. It must be in the same region as the Firehose stream and the role. The secret ARN can reside in a different account than the Firehose stream and role as Firehose supports cross-account secret access. This parameter is required when Enabled is set to True. RoleARN (string) --- Specifies the role that Firehose assumes when calling the Secrets Manager API operation. When you provide the role, it overrides any destination specific role defined in the destination configuration. If you do not provide the then we use the destination specific role. This parameter is required for Splunk. Specifies whether you want to use the secrets manager feature. When set as True the secrets manager configuration overwrites the existing secrets in the destination configuration. When it's set to False Firehose falls back to the credentials in the destination configuration. BufferingHints (dict) --- Describes the buffering to perform before delivering data to the Snowflake destination. SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MBs, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 128. The default value is 0.",

RetryOptions (dict) --- The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver data to a destination. DurationInSeconds (integer) --- The period of time during which Firehose retries to deliver data to the specified destination. RoleARN (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be assumed by Firehose for calling Apache Iceberg Tables. AppendOnly (boolean) --- Describes whether all incoming data for this delivery stream will be append only (inserts only and not for updates and deletes) for Iceberg delivery. This feature is only applicable for Apache Iceberg Tables. The default value is false. If you set this value to true, Firehose automatically increases the throughput limit of a stream based on the throttling levels of the stream. If you set this parameter to true for a stream with updates and deletes, you will see out of order delivery. CatalogConfiguration (dict) --- Configuration describing where the destination Iceberg tables are persisted. CatalogARN (string) --- Specifies the Glue catalog ARN identifier of the destination Apache Iceberg Tables. You must specify the ARN in the format arn:aws:glue:region:account-id:catalog. WarehouseLocation (string) --- The warehouse location for Apache Iceberg tables. You must configure this when schema evolution and table creation is enabled. S3Configuration (dict) --- Describes the configuration of a destination in Amazon S3. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services credentials. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces. The ARN of the S3 bucket. Prefix (string) --- The 'YYYY/MM/DD/HH' time format prefix is automatically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. ErrorOutputPrefix (string) --- A prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears immediately following the bucket name. For information about how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering option. If no value is specified, BufferingHints object default values are used. CompressionFormat (string) --- The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is UNCOMPRESSED. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not supported by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket. EncryptionConfiguration (dict) --- The encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the default is no encryption. NoEncryptionConfig (string) --- Specifically override existing encryption information to ensure that no encryption is used. KMSEncryptionConfig (dict) --- The encryption key. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key. Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. This value is required if CloudWatch logging is enabled.",
