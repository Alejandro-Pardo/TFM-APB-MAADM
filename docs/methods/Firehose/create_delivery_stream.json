  "description": "Creates a Firehose stream. By default, you can create up to 5,000 Firehose streams per Amazon Web Services Region. This is an asynchronous operation that immediately returns. The initial status of the Firehose stream is CREATING. After the Firehose stream is created, its status is ACTIVE and it now accepts data. If the Firehose stream creation fails, the status transitions to CREATING_FAILED. Attempts to send data to a delivery stream that is not in the ACTIVE state cause an exception. To check the state of a Firehose stream, use  DescribeDeliveryStream. If the status of a Firehose stream is CREATING_FAILED, this status doesn't change, and you can't invoke CreateDeliveryStream again on it. However, you can invoke the  DeleteDeliveryStream operation to delete it. A Firehose stream can be configured to receive records directly from providers using  PutRecord or  PutRecordBatch, or it can be configured to use an existing Kinesis stream as its source. To specify a Kinesis data stream as input, set the DeliveryStreamType parameter to KinesisStreamAsSource, and provide the Kinesis stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and role ARN in the KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration parameter. To create a Firehose stream with server-side encryption (SSE) enabled, include  DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput in your request. This is optional. You can also invoke  StartDeliveryStreamEncryption to turn on SSE for an existing Firehose stream that doesn't have SSE enabled. A Firehose stream is configured with a single destination, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, Splunk, and any custom HTTP endpoint or HTTP endpoints owned by or supported by third-party service providers, including Datadog, Dynatrace, LogicMonitor, MongoDB, New Relic, and Sumo Logic. You must specify only one of the following destination configuration parameters: ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration, S3DestinationConfiguration, ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration, RedshiftDestinationConfiguration, or SplunkDestinationConfiguration. When you specify S3DestinationConfiguration, you can also provide the following optional values: BufferingHints, EncryptionConfiguration, and CompressionFormat. By default, if no BufferingHints value is provided, Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes, whichever condition is satisfied first. BufferingHints is a hint, so there are some cases where the service cannot adhere to these conditions strictly. For example, record boundaries might be such that the size is a little over or under the configured buffering size. By default, no encryption is performed. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption to ensure secure data storage in Amazon S3. A few notes about Amazon Redshift as a destination: Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured as part of the destination. The role should allow the Firehose principal to assume the role, and the role should have permissions that allow the service to deliver the data. For more information, see Grant Firehose Access to an Amazon S3 Destination in the Amazon Firehose Developer Guide.",

CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. DataFormatConversionConfiguration (dict) --- The serializer, deserializer, and schema for converting data from the JSON format to the Parquet or ORC format before writing it to Amazon S3. SchemaConfiguration (dict) --- Specifies the Amazon Web Services Glue Data Catalog table that contains the column information. This parameter is required if Enabled is set to true. RoleARN (string) --- The role that Firehose can use to access Amazon Web Services Glue. This role must be in the same account you use for Firehose. Cross-account roles aren't allowed. CatalogId (string) --- The ID of the Amazon Web Services Glue Data Catalog. If you don't supply this, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by default. DatabaseName (string) --- Specifies the name of the Amazon Web Services Glue database that contains the schema for the output data. TableName (string) --- Specifies the Amazon Web Services Glue table that contains the column information that constitutes your data schema. Region (string) --- If you don't specify an Amazon Web Services Region, the default is the current Region. VersionId (string) --- Specifies the table version for the output data schema. If you don't specify this version ID, or if you set it to LATEST, Firehose uses the most recent version. This means that any updates to the table are automatically picked up. InputFormatConfiguration (dict) --- Specifies the deserializer that you want Firehose to use to convert the format of your data from JSON. Deserializer (dict) --- Specifies which deserializer to use. You can choose either the Apache Hive JSON SerDe or the OpenX JSON SerDe. If both are non-null, the server rejects the request. OpenXJsonSerDe (dict) --- The OpenX SerDe. Used by Firehose for deserializing data, which means converting it from the JSON format in preparation for serializing it to the Parquet or ORC format. This is one of two deserializers you can choose, depending on which one offers the functionality you need. The other option is the native Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe. ConvertDotsInJsonKeysToUnderscores (boolean) --- When set to true, specifies that the names of the keys include dots and that you want Firehose to replace them with underscores. This is useful because Apache Hive does not allow dots in column names. For example, if the JSON contains a key whose name is 'a.b', you can define the column name to be 'a_b' when using this option. The default is false. CaseInsensitive (boolean) --- When set to true, which is the default, Firehose converts JSON keys to lowercase before deserializing them. ColumnToJsonKeyMappings (dict) --- Maps column names to JSON keys that aren't identical to the column names. This is useful when the JSON contains keys that are Hive keywords. For example, timestamp is a Hive keyword. If you have a JSON key named timestamp, set this parameter to {\"ts\": \"timestamp\"} to map this key to a column named ts. (string) --- (string) --- HiveJsonSerDe (dict) --- The native Hive / HCatalog JsonSerDe. The other option is the OpenX SerDe. TimestampFormats (list) --- Indicates how you want Firehose to parse the date and timestamps that may be present in your input data JSON. To specify these format strings, follow the pattern syntax of JodaTime's DateTimeFormat format strings. For more information, see Class DateTimeFormat. You can also use the special value millis to parse timestamps in epoch milliseconds. If you don't specify a format, Firehose uses java.sql.Timestamp::valueOf by default. (string) --- OutputFormatConfiguration (dict) --- Specifies the serializer that you want Firehose to use to convert the format of your data to the Parquet or ORC format. Serializer (dict) --- Specifies which serializer to use. You can choose either the ORC SerDe or the Parquet SerDe. ParquetSerDe (dict) --- A serializer to use for converting data to the Parquet format before storing it in Amazon S3. For more information, see Apache Parquet. BlockSizeBytes (integer) --- The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) block size. This is useful if you intend to copy the data from Amazon S3 to HDFS before querying. The default is 256 MiB and the minimum is 64 MiB. Firehose uses this value for padding calculations. PageSizeBytes (integer) --- The Parquet page size. Column chunks are divided into pages. A page is conceptually an indivisible unit (in terms of compression and encoding). The minimum value is 64 KiB and the default is 1 MiB. Compression (string) --- The compression code to use over data blocks. The possible values are UNCOMPRESSED, SNAPPY, and GZIP, with the default being SNAPPY. Use SNAPPY for higher decompression speed. Use GZIP if the compression ratio is more important than speed. EnableDictionaryCompression (boolean) --- Indicates whether to enable dictionary compression. MaxPaddingBytes (integer) --- The maximum amount of padding to apply. The default is 0. WriterVersion (string) --- Indicates the version of row format to output. The possible values are V1 and V2. The default is V1. OrcSerDe (dict) --- A serializer to use for converting data to the ORC format before storing it in Amazon S3. For more information, see Apache ORC. StripeSizeBytes (integer) --- The number of bytes in each stripe. The default is 64 MiB and the minimum is 8 MiB. RowIndexStride (integer) --- The number of rows between index entries. The default is 10,000 and the minimum is 1,000. EnablePadding (boolean) --- Set this to true to indicate that you want stripes to be padded to the HDFS block boundaries. PaddingTolerance (float) --- A number between 0 and 1 that defines the tolerance for block padding as a decimal fraction of stripe size. The default value is 0.05, which means 5 percent of stripe size. For the default values of 64 MiB ORC stripes and 256 MiB HDFS blocks, the default block padding tolerance of 5 percent reserves a maximum of 3.2 MiB for padding within the 256 MiB block. In such a case, if the available size within the block is more than 3.2 MiB, a new, smaller stripe is inserted to fit within that space. This ensures that no stripe crosses block boundaries and causes remote reads within a node-local task. Firehose ignores this parameter when  OrcSerDe$EnablePadding is false. The default is SNAPPY. BloomFilterColumns (list) --- The column names for which you want Firehose to create bloom filters. The default is null. (string) --- BloomFilterFalsePositiveProbability (float) --- The Bloom filter false positive probability (FPP). The lower the FPP, the bigger the Bloom filter. The default value is 0.05, the minimum is 0, and the maximum is 1. DictionaryKeyThreshold (float) --- Represents the fraction of the total number of non-null rows. To turn off dictionary encoding, set this fraction to a number that is less than the number of distinct keys in a dictionary. To always use dictionary encoding, set this threshold to 1. FormatVersion (string) --- The version of the file to write. The possible values are V0_11 and V0_12. The default is V0_12. Enabled (boolean) --- Defaults to true. Set it to false if you want to disable format conversion while preserving the configuration details. DynamicPartitioningConfiguration (dict) --- The configuration of the dynamic partitioning mechanism that creates smaller data sets from the streaming data by partitioning it based on partition keys. Currently, dynamic partitioning is only supported for Amazon S3 destinations. RetryOptions (dict) --- The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver data to an Amazon S3 prefix. DurationInSeconds (integer) --- The period of time during which Firehose retries to deliver data to the specified destination. Enabled (boolean) --- Specifies that the dynamic partitioning is enabled for this Firehose stream. FileExtension (string) --- Specify a file extension. It will override the default file extension CustomTimeZone (string) --- The time zone you prefer. UTC is the default.",

For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces. The database connection string. The COPY command. The name of the target table. The table must already exist in the database. DataTableColumns (string) --- A comma-separated list of column names. CopyOptions (string) --- Optional parameters to use with the Amazon Redshift COPY command. For more information, see the 'Optional Parameters' section of Amazon Redshift COPY command. Some possible examples that would apply to Firehose are as follows: delimiter '\\t' lzop; - fields are delimited with 't' (TAB character) and compressed using lzop. delimiter '|' - fields are delimited with '|' (this is the default delimiter). delimiter '|' escape - the delimiter should be escaped. fixedwidth 'venueid:3,venuename:25,venuecity:12,venuestate:2,venueseats:6' - fields are fixed width in the source, with each width specified after every column in the table. JSON 's3://mybucket/jsonpaths.txt' - data is in JSON format, and the path specified is the format of the data. For more examples, see Amazon Redshift COPY command examples. Username (string) --- The name of the user. Password (string) --- The user password. RetryOptions (dict) --- The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver documents to Amazon Redshift. Default value is 3600 (60 minutes). DurationInSeconds (integer) --- The length of time during which Firehose retries delivery after a failure, starting from the initial request and including the first attempt. The default value is 3600 seconds (60 minutes). Firehose does not retry if the value of DurationInSeconds is 0 (zero) or if the first delivery attempt takes longer than the current value. The configuration for the intermediate Amazon S3 location from which Amazon Redshift obtains data. Restrictions are described in the topic for  CreateDeliveryStream. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified in RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration because the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket doesn't support these compression formats. The ARN of the S3 bucket. Prefix (string) --- The 'YYYY/MM/DD/HH' time format prefix is automatically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. ErrorOutputPrefix (string) --- A prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears immediately following the bucket name. For information about how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering option. If no value is specified, BufferingHints object default values are used. SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds, and vice versa. We recommend setting this parameter to a value greater than the amount of data you typically ingest into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher. IntervalInSeconds (integer) --- Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for SizeInMBs, and vice versa. CompressionFormat (string) --- The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is UNCOMPRESSED. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not supported by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket. EncryptionConfiguration (dict) --- The encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the default is no encryption. NoEncryptionConfig (string) --- Specifically override existing encryption information to ensure that no encryption is used. KMSEncryptionConfig (dict) --- The encryption key. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key. Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables CloudWatch logging. LogGroupName (string) --- The CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is required if CloudWatch logging is enabled. LogStreamName (string) --- The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. ProcessingConfiguration (dict) --- The data processing configuration. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables data processing. Processors (list) --- The data processors. (dict) --- Describes a data processor. The type of processor. Parameters (list) --- The processor parameters. (dict) --- Describes the processor parameter. The name of the parameter. Currently the following default values are supported: 3 for NumberOfRetries and 60 for the BufferIntervalInSeconds. The BufferSizeInMBs ranges between 0.2 MB and up to 3MB. The default buffering hint is 1MB for all destinations, except Splunk. For Splunk, the default buffering hint is 256 KB. The parameter value. S3BackupMode (string) --- The Amazon S3 backup mode. After you create a Firehose stream, you can update it to enable Amazon S3 backup if it is disabled. If backup is enabled, you can't update the Firehose stream to disable it. S3BackupConfiguration (dict) --- The configuration for backup in Amazon S3. SecretsManagerConfiguration (dict) --- The configuration that defines how you access secrets for Amazon Redshift. SecretARN (string) --- The ARN of the secret that stores your credentials. It must be in the same region as the Firehose stream and the role. The secret ARN can reside in a different account than the Firehose stream and role as Firehose supports cross-account secret access. This parameter is required when Enabled is set to True. RoleARN (string) --- Specifies the role that Firehose assumes when calling the Secrets Manager API operation. When you provide the role, it overrides any destination specific role defined in the destination configuration. If you do not provide the then we use the destination specific role. This parameter is required for Splunk. Specifies whether you want to use the secrets manager feature. When set as True the secrets manager configuration overwrites the existing secrets in the destination configuration. When it's set to False Firehose falls back to the credentials in the destination configuration.",

For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces. Specify either ClusterEndpoint or DomainARN. ClusterEndpoint (string) --- The endpoint to use when communicating with the cluster. Specify either this ClusterEndpoint or the DomainARN field. The Elasticsearch index name. TypeName (string) --- The Elasticsearch type name. For Elasticsearch 6.x, there can be only one type per index. If you try to specify a new type for an existing index that already has another type, Firehose returns an error during run time. For Elasticsearch 7.x, don't specify a TypeName. IndexRotationPeriod (string) --- The Elasticsearch index rotation period. Index rotation appends a timestamp to the IndexName to facilitate the expiration of old data. For more information, see Index Rotation for the Amazon OpenSearch Service Destination. The default value is\u00c2\u00a0 OneDay. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering options. If no value is specified, the default values for ElasticsearchBufferingHints are used. IntervalInSeconds (integer) --- Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 300 (5 minutes). SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MBs, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5. We recommend setting this parameter to a value greater than the amount of data you typically ingest into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MB/sec, the value should be 10 MB or higher. RetryOptions (dict) --- The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver documents to Amazon OpenSearch Service. DurationInSeconds (integer) --- After an initial failure to deliver to Amazon OpenSearch Service, the total amount of time during which Firehose retries delivery (including the first attempt). After this time has elapsed, the failed documents are written to Amazon S3. Default value is 300 seconds (5 minutes). A value of 0 (zero) results in no retries. S3BackupMode (string) --- Defines how documents should be delivered to Amazon S3. When it is set to FailedDocumentsOnly, Firehose writes any documents that could not be indexed to the configured Amazon S3 destination, with AmazonOpenSearchService-failed/ appended to the key prefix. When set to AllDocuments, Firehose delivers all incoming records to Amazon S3, and also writes failed documents with AmazonOpenSearchService-failed/ appended to the prefix. For more information, see Amazon S3 Backup for the Amazon OpenSearch Service Destination. Default value is FailedDocumentsOnly. You can't change this backup mode after you create the Firehose stream. The configuration for the backup Amazon S3 location. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services credentials. The ARN of the S3 bucket. Prefix (string) --- The 'YYYY/MM/DD/HH' time format prefix is automatically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. ErrorOutputPrefix (string) --- A prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears immediately following the bucket name. For information about how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering option. If no value is specified, BufferingHints object default values are used. SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, before delivering it to the destination. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds, and vice versa. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher. The default value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for SizeInMBs, and vice versa. CompressionFormat (string) --- The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is UNCOMPRESSED. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not supported by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket. EncryptionConfiguration (dict) --- The encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the default is no encryption. NoEncryptionConfig (string) --- Specifically override existing encryption information to ensure that no encryption is used. KMSEncryptionConfig (dict) --- The encryption key. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key. Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables CloudWatch logging. LogGroupName (string) --- The CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is required if CloudWatch logging is enabled. LogStreamName (string) --- The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. ProcessingConfiguration (dict) --- The data processing configuration. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables data processing. Processors (list) --- The data processors. (dict) --- Describes a data processor. The type of processor. Parameters (list) --- The processor parameters. (dict) --- Describes the processor parameter. The name of the parameter. Currently the following default values are supported: 3 for NumberOfRetries and 60 for the BufferIntervalInSeconds. The BufferSizeInMBs ranges between 0.2 MB and up to 3MB. The default buffering hint is 1MB for all destinations, except Splunk. For Splunk, the default buffering hint is 256 KB. The parameter value. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The Amazon CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. VpcConfiguration (dict) --- The details of the VPC of the Amazon destination. The IDs of the subnets that you want Firehose to use to create ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon OpenSearch Service destination. Make sure that the routing tables and inbound and outbound rules allow traffic to flow from the subnets whose IDs are specified here to the subnets that have the destination Amazon OpenSearch Service endpoints. Firehose creates at least one ENI in each of the subnets that are specified here. Do not delete or modify these ENIs. The number of ENIs that Firehose creates in the subnets specified here scales up and down automatically based on throughput. To enable Firehose to scale up the number of ENIs to match throughput, ensure that you have sufficient quota. To help you calculate the quota you need, assume that Firehose can create up to three ENIs for this Firehose stream for each of the subnets specified here. For more information about ENI quota, see Network Interfaces in the Amazon VPC Quotas topic. (string) --- The ARN of the IAM role that you want the Firehose stream to use to create endpoints in the destination VPC. You can use your existing Firehose delivery role or you can specify a new role. In either case, make sure that the role trusts the Firehose service principal and that it grants the following permissions: ec2:DescribeVpcs ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute ec2:DescribeSubnets ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces ec2:CreateNetworkInterface ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface The IDs of the security groups that you want Firehose to use when it creates ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon OpenSearch Service destination. You can use the same security group that the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain uses or different ones. If you specify different security groups here, ensure that they allow outbound HTTPS traffic to the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain's security group. Also ensure that the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain's security group allows HTTPS traffic from the security groups specified here. If you use the same security group for both your delivery stream and the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain, make sure the security group inbound rule allows HTTPS traffic. For more information about security group rules, see Security group rules in the Amazon VPC documentation. (string) --- DocumentIdOptions (dict) --- Indicates the method for setting up document ID. The supported methods are Firehose generated document ID and OpenSearch Service generated document ID. When the FIREHOSE_DEFAULT option is chosen, Firehose generates a unique document ID for each record based on a unique internal identifier. The generated document ID is stable across multiple delivery attempts, which helps prevent the same record from being indexed multiple times with different document IDs. When the NO_DOCUMENT_ID option is chosen, Firehose does not include any document IDs in the requests it sends to the Amazon OpenSearch Service. This causes the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain to generate document IDs. In case of multiple delivery attempts, this may cause the same record to be indexed more than once with different document IDs. This option enables write-heavy operations, such as the ingestion of logs and observability data, to consume less resources in the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain, resulting in improved performance.",

CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables CloudWatch logging. LogGroupName (string) --- The CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is required if CloudWatch logging is enabled. LogStreamName (string) --- The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. ProcessingConfiguration (dict) --- Describes a data processing configuration. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables data processing. Processors (list) --- The data processors. (dict) --- Describes a data processor. The type of processor. Parameters (list) --- The processor parameters. (dict) --- Describes the processor parameter. The name of the parameter. Currently the following default values are supported: 3 for NumberOfRetries and 60 for the BufferIntervalInSeconds. The BufferSizeInMBs ranges between 0.2 MB and up to 3MB. The default buffering hint is 1MB for all destinations, except Splunk. For Splunk, the default buffering hint is 256 KB. The parameter value. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- Describes the Amazon CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. VpcConfiguration (dict) --- The details of the VPC of the Amazon OpenSearch or Amazon OpenSearch Serverless destination. The IDs of the subnets that you want Firehose to use to create ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon OpenSearch Service destination. Make sure that the routing tables and inbound and outbound rules allow traffic to flow from the subnets whose IDs are specified here to the subnets that have the destination Amazon OpenSearch Service endpoints. Firehose creates at least one ENI in each of the subnets that are specified here. Do not delete or modify these ENIs. The number of ENIs that Firehose creates in the subnets specified here scales up and down automatically based on throughput. To enable Firehose to scale up the number of ENIs to match throughput, ensure that you have sufficient quota. To help you calculate the quota you need, assume that Firehose can create up to three ENIs for this Firehose stream for each of the subnets specified here. For more information about ENI quota, see Network Interfaces in the Amazon VPC Quotas topic. (string) --- The ARN of the IAM role that you want the Firehose stream to use to create endpoints in the destination VPC. You can use your existing Firehose delivery role or you can specify a new role. In either case, make sure that the role trusts the Firehose service principal and that it grants the following permissions: ec2:DescribeVpcs ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute ec2:DescribeSubnets ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces ec2:CreateNetworkInterface ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface The IDs of the security groups that you want Firehose to use when it creates ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon OpenSearch Service destination. You can use the same security group that the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain uses or different ones. If you specify different security groups here, ensure that they allow outbound HTTPS traffic to the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain's security group. Also ensure that the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain's security group allows HTTPS traffic from the security groups specified here. If you use the same security group for both your delivery stream and the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain, make sure the security group inbound rule allows HTTPS traffic. For more information about security group rules, see Security group rules in the Amazon VPC documentation. (string) --- DocumentIdOptions (dict) --- Indicates the method for setting up document ID. The supported methods are Firehose generated document ID and OpenSearch Service generated document ID. When the FIREHOSE_DEFAULT option is chosen, Firehose generates a unique document ID for each record based on a unique internal identifier. The generated document ID is stable across multiple delivery attempts, which helps prevent the same record from being indexed multiple times with different document IDs. When the NO_DOCUMENT_ID option is chosen, Firehose does not include any document IDs in the requests it sends to the Amazon OpenSearch Service. This causes the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain to generate document IDs. In case of multiple delivery attempts, this may cause the same record to be indexed more than once with different document IDs. This option enables write-heavy operations, such as the ingestion of logs and observability data, to consume less resources in the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain, resulting in improved performance.",

This type can be either 'Raw' or 'Event.' HECToken (string) --- This is a GUID that you obtain from your Splunk cluster when you create a new HEC endpoint. HECAcknowledgmentTimeoutInSeconds (integer) --- The amount of time that Firehose waits to receive an acknowledgment from Splunk after it sends it data. At the end of the timeout period, Firehose either tries to send the data again or considers it an error, based on your retry settings. RetryOptions (dict) --- The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver data to Splunk, or if it doesn't receive an acknowledgment of receipt from Splunk. DurationInSeconds (integer) --- The total amount of time that Firehose spends on retries. This duration starts after the initial attempt to send data to Splunk fails. It doesn't include the periods during which Firehose waits for acknowledgment from Splunk after each attempt. S3BackupMode (string) --- Defines how documents should be delivered to Amazon S3. When set to FailedEventsOnly, Firehose writes any data that could not be indexed to the configured Amazon S3 destination. When set to AllEvents, Firehose delivers all incoming records to Amazon S3, and also writes failed documents to Amazon S3. The default value is FailedEventsOnly. You can update this backup mode from FailedEventsOnly to AllEvents. You can't update it from AllEvents to FailedEventsOnly. The configuration for the backup Amazon S3 location. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services credentials. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces. The ARN of the S3 bucket. Prefix (string) --- The 'YYYY/MM/DD/HH' time format prefix is automatically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. ErrorOutputPrefix (string) --- A prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears immediately following the bucket name. For information about how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering option. If no value is specified, BufferingHints object default values are used. SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds, and vice versa. We recommend setting this parameter to a value greater than the amount of data you typically ingest into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher. IntervalInSeconds (integer) --- Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for SizeInMBs, and vice versa. CompressionFormat (string) --- The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is UNCOMPRESSED. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not supported by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket. EncryptionConfiguration (dict) --- The encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the default is no encryption. NoEncryptionConfig (string) --- Specifically override existing encryption information to ensure that no encryption is used. KMSEncryptionConfig (dict) --- The encryption key. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key. Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket.

(dict) --- Describes a data processor. The type of processor. Parameters (list) --- The processor parameters. (dict) --- Describes the processor parameter. The name of the parameter. Currently the following default values are supported: 3 for NumberOfRetries and 60 for the BufferIntervalInSeconds. The BufferSizeInMBs ranges between 0.2 MB and up to 3MB. The default buffering hint is 1MB for all destinations, except Splunk. For Splunk, the default buffering hint is 256 KB. The parameter value. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The Amazon CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering options. If no value is specified, the default values for Splunk are used. The default value is 60 (1 minute). SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MBs, before delivering it to the destination. SecretsManagerConfiguration (dict) --- The configuration that defines how you access secrets for Splunk. SecretARN (string) --- The ARN of the secret that stores your credentials. It must be in the same region as the Firehose stream and the role. The secret ARN can reside in a different account than the Firehose stream and role as Firehose supports cross-account secret access. This parameter is required when Enabled is set to True. RoleARN (string) --- Specifies the role that Firehose assumes when calling the Secrets Manager API operation. When you provide the role, it overrides any destination specific role defined in the destination configuration. If you do not provide the then we use the destination specific role. This parameter is required for Splunk. Specifies whether you want to use the secrets manager feature. When set as True the secrets manager configuration overwrites the existing secrets in the destination configuration. When it's set to False Firehose falls back to the credentials in the destination configuration.",

The configuration of the HTTP endpoint selected as the destination. The URL of the HTTP endpoint selected as the destination. Name (string) --- The name of the HTTP endpoint selected as the destination. AccessKey (string) --- The access key required for Kinesis Firehose to authenticate with the HTTP endpoint selected as the destination. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering options that can be used before data is delivered to the specified destination. Firehose treats these options as hints, and it might choose to use more optimal values. The SizeInMBs and IntervalInSeconds parameters are optional. However, if you specify a value for one of them, you must also provide a value for the other. SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MBs, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5. We recommend setting this parameter to a value greater than the amount of data you typically ingest into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MB/sec, the value should be 10 MB or higher. IntervalInSeconds (integer) --- Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 300 (5 minutes). CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- Describes the Amazon CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables CloudWatch logging. LogGroupName (string) --- The CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is required if CloudWatch logging is enabled. LogStreamName (string) --- The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. RequestConfiguration (dict) --- The configuration of the request sent to the HTTP endpoint that is specified as the destination. ContentEncoding (string) --- Firehose uses the content encoding to compress the body of a request before sending the request to the destination. For more information, see Content-Encoding in MDN Web Docs, the official Mozilla documentation. CommonAttributes (list) --- Describes the metadata sent to the HTTP endpoint destination. (dict) --- Describes the metadata that's delivered to the specified HTTP endpoint destination. The name of the HTTP endpoint common attribute. The value of the HTTP endpoint common attribute. ProcessingConfiguration (dict) --- Describes a data processing configuration. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables data processing. Processors (list) --- The data processors. (dict) --- Describes a data processor. The type of processor. Parameters (list) --- The processor parameters. (dict) --- Describes the processor parameter. The name of the parameter. Currently the following default values are supported: 3 for NumberOfRetries and 60 for the BufferIntervalInSeconds. The BufferSizeInMBs ranges between 0.2 MB and up to 3MB. The default buffering hint is 1MB for all destinations, except Splunk. For Splunk, the default buffering hint is 256 KB. The parameter value. RoleARN (string) --- Firehose uses this IAM role for all the permissions that the delivery stream needs. RetryOptions (dict) --- Describes the retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver data to the specified HTTP endpoint destination, or if it doesn't receive a valid acknowledgment of receipt from the specified HTTP endpoint destination. DurationInSeconds (integer) --- The total amount of time that Firehose spends on retries. This duration starts after the initial attempt to send data to the custom destination via HTTPS endpoint fails. It doesn't include the periods during which Firehose waits for acknowledgment from the specified destination after each attempt. S3BackupMode (string) --- Describes the S3 bucket backup options for the data that Firehose delivers to the HTTP endpoint destination. You can back up all documents ( AllData) or only the documents that Firehose could not deliver to the specified HTTP endpoint destination ( FailedDataOnly). Describes the configuration of a destination in Amazon S3. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services credentials. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces. The ARN of the S3 bucket. Prefix (string) --- The 'YYYY/MM/DD/HH' time format prefix is automatically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. ErrorOutputPrefix (string) --- A prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears immediately following the bucket name. For information about how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering option. If no value is specified, BufferingHints object default values are used. SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, before delivering it to the destination. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds, and vice versa. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher. The default value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for SizeInMBs, and vice versa. CompressionFormat (string) --- The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is UNCOMPRESSED. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not supported by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket. EncryptionConfiguration (dict) --- The encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the default is no encryption. NoEncryptionConfig (string) --- Specifically override existing encryption information to ensure that no encryption is used. KMSEncryptionConfig (dict) --- The encryption key. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key. Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. SecretsManagerConfiguration (dict) --- The configuration that defines how you access secrets for HTTP Endpoint destination. SecretARN (string) --- The ARN of the secret that stores your credentials. It must be in the same region as the Firehose stream and the role. The secret ARN can reside in a different account than the Firehose stream and role as Firehose supports cross-account secret access. This parameter is required when Enabled is set to True. RoleARN (string) --- Specifies the role that Firehose assumes when calling the Secrets Manager API operation. When you provide the role, it overrides any destination specific role defined in the destination configuration. If you do not provide the then we use the destination specific role. This parameter is required for Splunk. Specifies whether you want to use the secrets manager feature. When set as True the secrets manager configuration overwrites the existing secrets in the destination configuration. When it's set to False Firehose falls back to the credentials in the destination configuration.",

If no value is specified, BufferingHints object default values are used. SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, before delivering it to the destination. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds, and vice versa. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher. The default value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for SizeInMBs, and vice versa. CompressionFormat (string) --- The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is UNCOMPRESSED. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not supported by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket. EncryptionConfiguration (dict) --- The encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the default is no encryption.

CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- Describes the Amazon CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. VpcConfiguration (dict) --- The details of the VPC of the Amazon OpenSearch or Amazon OpenSearch Serverless destination. The IDs of the subnets that you want Firehose to use to create ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon OpenSearch Service destination. Make sure that the routing tables and inbound and outbound rules allow traffic to flow from the subnets whose IDs are specified here to the subnets that have the destination Amazon OpenSearch Service endpoints. Firehose creates at least one ENI in each of the subnets that are specified here. Do not delete or modify these ENIs. The number of ENIs that Firehose creates in the subnets specified here scales up and down automatically based on throughput. To enable Firehose to scale up the number of ENIs to match throughput, ensure that you have sufficient quota. To help you calculate the quota you need, assume that Firehose can create up to three ENIs for this Firehose stream for each of the subnets specified here. For more information about ENI quota, see Network Interfaces in the Amazon VPC Quotas topic. (string) --- The ARN of the IAM role that you want the Firehose stream to use to create endpoints in the destination VPC. You can use your existing Firehose delivery role or you can specify a new role. In either case, make sure that the role trusts the Firehose service principal and that it grants the following permissions: ec2:DescribeVpcs ec2:DescribeVpcAttribute ec2:DescribeSubnets ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces ec2:CreateNetworkInterface ec2:CreateNetworkInterfacePermission ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface The IDs of the security groups that you want Firehose to use when it creates ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon OpenSearch Service destination. You can use the same security group that the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain uses or different ones. If you specify different security groups here, ensure that they allow outbound HTTPS traffic to the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain's security group. Also ensure that the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain's security group allows HTTPS traffic from the security groups specified here. If you use the same security group for both your delivery stream and the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain, make sure the security group inbound rule allows HTTPS traffic. For more information about security group rules, see Security group rules in the Amazon VPC documentation. (string) ---",

DestinationTableConfigurationList (list) --- Provides a list of DestinationTableConfigurations which Firehose uses to deliver data to Apache Iceberg Tables. Firehose will write data with insert if table specific configuration is not provided here. (dict) --- Describes the configuration of a destination in Apache Iceberg Tables. Specifies the name of the Apache Iceberg Table. The name of the Apache Iceberg database. UniqueKeys (list) --- A list of unique keys for a given Apache Iceberg table. Firehose will use these for running Create, Update, or Delete operations on the given Iceberg table. (string) --- PartitionSpec (dict) --- The partition spec configuration for a table that is used by automatic table creation. Amazon Data Firehose is in preview release and is subject to change. Identity (list) --- List of identity transforms that performs an identity transformation. The transform takes the source value, and does not modify it. Result type is the source type. (dict) --- Represents a single field in a PartitionSpec. The column name to be configured in partition spec. S3ErrorOutputPrefix (string) --- The table specific S3 error output prefix. All the errors that occurred while delivering to this table will be prefixed with this value in S3 destination. SchemaEvolutionConfiguration (dict) --- The configuration to enable automatic schema evolution. Specify whether you want to enable schema evolution. TableCreationConfiguration (dict) --- The configuration to enable automatic table creation. Specify whether you want to enable automatic table creation. BufferingHints (dict) --- Describes hints for the buffering to perform before delivering data to the destination. These options are treated as hints, and therefore Firehose might choose to use different values when it is optimal. The SizeInMBs and IntervalInSeconds parameters are optional. However, if specify a value for one of them, you must also provide a value for the other. SizeInMBs (integer) --- Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for IntervalInSeconds, and vice versa. We recommend setting this parameter to a value greater than the amount of data you typically ingest into the Firehose stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MiB/sec, the value should be 10 MiB or higher. IntervalInSeconds (integer) --- Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 300. This parameter is optional but if you specify a value for it, you must also specify a value for SizeInMBs, and vice versa. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- Describes the Amazon CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables CloudWatch logging. LogGroupName (string) --- The CloudWatch group name for logging. This value is required if CloudWatch logging is enabled. LogStreamName (string) --- The CloudWatch log stream name for logging. ProcessingConfiguration (dict) --- Describes a data processing configuration. Enabled (boolean) --- Enables or disables data processing. Processors (list) --- The data processors. (dict) --- Describes a data processor. The type of processor. Parameters (list) --- The processor parameters. (dict) --- Describes the processor parameter. The name of the parameter. Currently the following default values are supported: 3 for NumberOfRetries and 60 for the BufferIntervalInSeconds. The BufferSizeInMBs ranges between 0.2 MB and up to 3MB. The default buffering hint is 1MB for all destinations, except Splunk. For Splunk, the default buffering hint is 256 KB. The parameter value. S3BackupMode (string) --- Describes how Firehose will backup records. Currently,S3 backup only supports FailedDataOnly. RetryOptions (dict) --- The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver data to a destination. DurationInSeconds (integer) --- The period of time during which Firehose retries to deliver data to the specified destination. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be assumed by Firehose for calling Apache Iceberg Tables. AppendOnly (boolean) --- Describes whether all incoming data for this delivery stream will be append only (inserts only and not for updates and deletes) for Iceberg delivery. This feature is only applicable for Apache Iceberg Tables. The default value is false. If you set this value to true, Firehose automatically increases the throughput limit of a stream based on the throttling levels of the stream. If you set this parameter to true for a stream with updates and deletes, you will see out of order delivery. Configuration describing where the destination Apache Iceberg Tables are persisted. CatalogARN (string) --- Specifies the Glue catalog ARN identifier of the destination Apache Iceberg Tables. You must specify the ARN in the format arn:aws:glue:region:account-id:catalog. WarehouseLocation (string) --- The warehouse location for Apache Iceberg tables. You must configure this when schema evolution and table creation is enabled. Describes the configuration of a destination in Amazon S3. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services credentials. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces. The ARN of the S3 bucket. Prefix (string) --- The 'YYYY/MM/DD/HH' time format prefix is automatically used for delivered Amazon S3 files. You can also specify a custom prefix, as described in Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. ErrorOutputPrefix (string) --- A prefix that Firehose evaluates and adds to failed records before writing them to S3. This prefix appears immediately following the bucket name. For information about how to specify this prefix, see Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects. BufferingHints (dict) --- The buffering option. If no value is specified, BufferingHints object default values are used. CompressionFormat (string) --- The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is UNCOMPRESSED. The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified for Amazon Redshift destinations because they are not supported by the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket. EncryptionConfiguration (dict) --- The encryption configuration. If no value is specified, the default is no encryption. NoEncryptionConfig (string) --- Specifically override existing encryption information to ensure that no encryption is used. KMSEncryptionConfig (dict) --- The encryption key. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key. Must belong to the same Amazon Web Services Region as the destination Amazon S3 bucket. CloudWatchLoggingOptions (dict) --- The CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream. This value is required if CloudWatch logging is enabled.",
