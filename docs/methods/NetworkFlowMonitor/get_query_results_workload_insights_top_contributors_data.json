  "description": "Return the data for a query with the Network Flow Monitor query interface. Specify the query that you want to return results for by providing a query ID and a scope ID. This query returns the data for top contributors for workload insights for a specific scope. Workload insights provide a high level view of network flow performance data collected by agents for a scope. To return just the top contributors, see GetQueryResultsWorkloadInsightsTopContributors. Create a query ID for this call by calling the corresponding API call to start the query, StartQueryWorkloadInsightsTopContributorsData. Use the scope ID that was returned for your account by CreateScope. Top contributors in Network Flow Monitor are network flows with the highest values for a specific metric type. Top contributors can be across all workload insights, for a given scope, or for a specific monitor. Use the applicable call for the top contributors that you want to be returned. The top contributor network flows overall are for a specific metric type, for example, the number of retransmissions.",
