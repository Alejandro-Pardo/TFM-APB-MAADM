  "description": "To post metering records for customers, SaaS applications call BatchMeterUsage, which is used for metering SaaS flexible consumption pricing (FCP). Identical requests are idempotent and can be retried with the same records or a subset of records. Each BatchMeterUsage request is for only one product. If you want to meter usage for multiple products, you must make multiple BatchMeterUsage calls. Usage records should be submitted in quick succession following a recorded event. Usage records aren't accepted 6 hours or more after an event. BatchMeterUsage can process up to 25 UsageRecords at a time, and each request must be less than 1 MB in size. Optionally, you can have multiple usage allocations for usage data that's split into buckets according to predefined tags. BatchMeterUsage returns a list of UsageRecordResult objects, which have each UsageRecord. It also returns a list of UnprocessedRecords, which indicate errors on the service side that should be retried. For Amazon Web Services Regions that support BatchMeterUsage, see BatchMeterUsage Region support.",

(dict) --- A UsageRecord indicates a quantity of usage for a given product, customer, dimension and time. Multiple requests with the same UsageRecords as input will be de-duplicated to prevent double charges. Timestamp, in UTC, for which the usage is being reported. Your application can meter usage for up to one hour in the past. Make sure the timestamp value is not before the start of the software usage. CustomerIdentifier (string) --- The CustomerIdentifier is obtained through the ResolveCustomer operation and represents an individual buyer in your application. During the process of registering a product on Amazon Web Services Marketplace, dimensions are specified. These represent different units of value in your application. Quantity (integer) --- The quantity of usage consumed by the customer for the given dimension and time. Defaults to 0 if not specified. UsageAllocations (list) --- The set of UsageAllocations to submit. The sum of all UsageAllocation quantities must equal the Quantity of the UsageRecord. (dict) --- Usage allocations allow you to split usage into buckets by tags. Each UsageAllocation indicates the usage quantity for a specific set of tags. The total quantity allocated to this bucket of usage. Tags (list) --- The set of tags that define the bucket of usage. For the bucket of items with no tags, this parameter can be left out. (dict) --- Metadata assigned to an allocation. Each tag is made up of a key and a value. One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is a label that acts like a category for the specific tag values. A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key). The value can be empty or null.
