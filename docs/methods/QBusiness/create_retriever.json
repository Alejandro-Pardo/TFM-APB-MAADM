The identifier for the Amazon Q Business index. version (integer) --- A read-only field that specifies the version of the NativeIndexConfiguration. Amazon Q Business introduces enhanced document retrieval capabilities in version 2 of NativeIndexConfiguration, focusing on streamlined metadata boosting that prioritizes recency and source relevance to deliver more accurate responses to your queries. Version 2 has the following differences from version 1: Version 2 supports a single Date field (created_at OR last_updated_at) for recency boosting Version 2 supports a single String field with an ordered list of up to 5 values Version 2 introduces number-based boost levels (ONE, TWO) alongside the text-based levels Version 2 allows specifying prioritization between Date and String fields Version 2 maintains backward compatibility with existing configurations boostingOverride (dict) --- Overrides the default boosts applied by Amazon Q Business to supported document attribute data types. (string) --- (dict) --- Provides information on boosting supported Amazon Q Business document attribute types. When an end user chat query matches document attributes that have been boosted, Amazon Q Business prioritizes generating responses from content that matches the boosted document attributes. In version 2, boosting uses numeric values (ONE, TWO) to indicate priority tiers that establish clear hierarchical relationships between boosted attributes. This allows for more precise control over how different attributes influence search results. For more information on how boosting document attributes work in Amazon Q Business, see Boosting using document attributes. numberConfiguration (dict) --- Provides information on boosting NUMBER type document attributes. NUMBER attributes are not supported when using NativeIndexConfiguration version 2, which focuses on DATE attributes for recency and STRING attributes for source prioritization. Specifies the priority of boosted document attributes in relation to other boosted attributes. This parameter determines how strongly the attribute influences document ranking in search results. NUMBER attributes can serve as additional boosting factors when needed, but are not supported when using NativeIndexConfiguration version 2. boostingType (string) --- Specifies whether higher or lower numeric values should be prioritized when boosting. Valid values are ASCENDING (higher numbers are more important) and DESCENDING (lower numbers are more important). stringConfiguration (dict) --- Provides information on boosting STRING type document attributes. Version 2 assigns priority tiers to STRING attributes, establishing clear hierarchical relationships with other boosted attributes. Specifies the priority tier ranking of boosting applied to document attributes. For version 2, this parameter indicates the relative ranking between boosted fields (ONE being highest priority, TWO being second highest, etc.) and determines the order in which attributes influence document ranking in search results. For version 1, this parameter specifies the boosting intensity. For version 2, boosting intensity (VERY HIGH, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, NONE) are not supported. Note that in version 2, you are not allowed to boost on only one field and make this value TWO. attributeValueBoosting (dict) --- Specifies specific values of a STRING type document attribute being boosted. When using NativeIndexConfiguration version 2, you can specify up to five values in order of priority. (string) --- (string) --- dateConfiguration (dict) --- Provides information on boosting DATE type document attributes. Version 2 assigns priority tiers to DATE attributes, establishing clear hierarchical relationships with other boosted attributes. boostingDurationInSeconds (integer) --- Specifies the duration, in seconds, of a boost applies to a DATE type document attribute. stringListConfiguration (dict) --- Provides information on boosting STRING_LIST type document attributes. STRING_LIST attributes are not supported when using NativeIndexConfiguration version 2, which focuses on DATE attributes for recency and STRING attributes for source prioritization. STRING_LIST attributes can serve as additional boosting factors when needed, but are not supported when using NativeIndexConfiguration version 2. kendraIndexConfiguration (dict) --- Provides information on how the Amazon Kendra index used as a retriever for your Amazon Q Business application is configured.
