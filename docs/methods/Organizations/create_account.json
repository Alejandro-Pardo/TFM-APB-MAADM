  "description": "Creates an Amazon Web Services account that is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because CreateAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following: The user who calls the API to create an account must have the organizations:CreateAccount permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, Organizations creates the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see Organizations and service-linked roles in the Organizations User Guide. If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the organizations:TagResource permission. Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named OrganizationAccountAccessRole by default) that grants users in the management account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the management account can assume the role. Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new account from the organization's management account. This operation can be called only from the organization's management account. For more information about creating accounts, see Creating a member account in your organization in the Organizations User Guide.",
