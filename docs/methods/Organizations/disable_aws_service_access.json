  "description": "Disables the integration of an Amazon Web Services service (the service that is specified by ServicePrincipal) with Organizations. When you disable integration, the specified service no longer can create a service-linked role in new accounts in your organization. This means the service can't perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean-up from Organizations. After you perform the DisableAWSServiceAccess operation, the specified service can no longer perform operations in your organization's accounts. For more information about integrating other services with Organizations, including the list of services that work with Organizations, see Using Organizations with other Amazon Web Services services in the Organizations User Guide. This operation can be called only from the organization's management account.",
