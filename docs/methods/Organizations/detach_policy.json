  "description": "Detaches a policy from a target root, organizational unit (OU), or account. Every root, OU, and account must have at least one SCP attached. If you want to replace the default FullAWSAccess policy with an SCP that limits the permissions that can be delegated, you must attach the replacement SCP before you can remove the default SCP. This is the authorization strategy of an ' allow list'. If you instead attach a second SCP and leave the FullAWSAccess SCP still attached, and specify \"Effect\": \"Deny\" in the second SCP to override the \"Effect\": \"Allow\" in the FullAWSAccess policy (or any other attached SCP), you're using the authorization strategy of a ' deny list'. This operation can be called only from the organization's management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator.",
