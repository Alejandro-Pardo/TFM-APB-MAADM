  "description": "Restores a backup to a server that is in a CONNECTION_LOST, HEALTHY, RUNNING, UNHEALTHY, or TERMINATED state. When you run RestoreServer, the server's EC2 instance is deleted, and a new EC2 instance is configured. RestoreServer maintains the existing server endpoint, so configuration management of the server's client devices (nodes) should continue to work. Restoring from a backup is performed by creating a new EC2 instance. If restoration is successful, and the server is in a HEALTHY state, OpsWorks CM switches traffic over to the new instance. After restoration is finished, the old EC2 instance is maintained in a Running or Stopped state, but is eventually terminated. This operation is asynchronous. An InvalidStateException is thrown when the server is not in a valid state. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server does not exist. A ValidationException is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.",
