After the server is deleted, it is no longer returned by DescribeServer requests. If the CloudFormation stack cannot be deleted, the server cannot be deleted. This operation is asynchronous. An InvalidStateException is thrown when a server deletion is already in progress. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server does not exist. A ValidationException is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.",
