Connectivity information includes endpoints and ports where client devices can connect to an MQTT broker on the core device. When a client device calls the IoT Greengrass discovery API, IoT Greengrass returns connectivity information for all of the core devices where the client device can connect. For more information, see Connect client devices to core devices in the IoT Greengrass Version 2 Developer Guide.",
