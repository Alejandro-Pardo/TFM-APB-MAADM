Use this action to designate an existing bucket for log delivery. If the existing bucket has previously been a target for CloudTrail log files, an IAM policy exists for the bucket. UpdateTrail must be called from the Region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an InvalidHomeRegionException is thrown.",
