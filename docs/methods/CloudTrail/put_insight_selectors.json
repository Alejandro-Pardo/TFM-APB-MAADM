  "description": "Lets you enable Insights event logging by specifying the Insights selectors that you want to enable on an existing trail or event data store. You also use PutInsightSelectors to turn off Insights event logging, by passing an empty list of Insights types. The valid Insights event types are ApiErrorRateInsight and ApiCallRateInsight. To enable Insights on an event data store, you must specify the ARNs (or ID suffix of the ARNs) for the source event data store ( EventDataStore) and the destination event data store ( InsightsDestination). The source event data store logs management events and enables Insights. The destination event data store logs Insights events based upon the management event activity of the source event data store. The source and destination event data stores must belong to the same Amazon Web Services account. To log Insights events for a trail, you must specify the name ( TrailName) of the CloudTrail trail for which you want to change or add Insights selectors. To log CloudTrail Insights events on API call volume, the trail or event data store must log write management events. To log CloudTrail Insights events on API error rate, the trail or event data store must log read or write management events. You can call GetEventSelectors on a trail to check whether the trail logs management events. You can call GetEventDataStore on an event data store to check whether the event data store logs management events. For more information, see Working with CloudTrail Insights in the CloudTrail User Guide.",
