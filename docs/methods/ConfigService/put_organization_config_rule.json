  "description": "Adds or updates an Config rule for your entire organization to evaluate if your Amazon Web Services resources comply with your desired configurations. For information on how many organization Config rules you can have per account, see **Service Limits** in the Config Developer Guide. Only a management account and a delegated administrator can create or update an organization Config rule. When calling this API with a delegated administrator, you must ensure Organizations ListDelegatedAdministrator permissions are added. An organization can have up to 3 delegated administrators. This API enables organization service access through the EnableAWSServiceAccess action and creates a service-linked role AWSServiceRoleForConfigMultiAccountSetup in the management or delegated administrator account of your organization. The service-linked role is created only when the role does not exist in the caller account. Config verifies the existence of role with GetRole action. To use this API with delegated administrator, register a delegated administrator by calling Amazon Web Services Organization register-delegated-administrator for config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com. There are two types of rules: Config Managed Rules and Config Custom Rules. You can use PutOrganizationConfigRule to create both Config Managed Rules and Config Custom Rules. Config Managed Rules are predefined, customizable rules created by Config. For a list of managed rules, see List of Config Managed Rules. If you are adding an Config managed rule, you must specify the rule's identifier for the RuleIdentifier key. Config Custom Rules are rules that you create from scratch. There are two ways to create Config custom rules: with Lambda functions ( Lambda Developer Guide) and with Guard ( Guard GitHub Repository), a policy-as-code language. Config custom rules created with Lambda are called Config Custom Lambda Rules and Config custom rules created with Guard are called Config Custom Policy Rules. If you are adding a new Config Custom Lambda rule, you first need to create an Lambda function in the management account or a delegated administrator that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. You also need to create an IAM role in the managed account that can be assumed by the Lambda function. When you use PutOrganizationConfigRule to add a Custom Lambda rule to Config, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Lambda assigns to the function.",
