  "description": "Adds an identity source to a policy store---an Amazon Cognito user pool or OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider (IdP). After you create an identity source, you can use the identities provided by the IdP as proxies for the principal in authorization queries that use the IsAuthorizedWithToken or BatchIsAuthorizedWithToken API operations. These identities take the form of tokens that contain claims about the user, such as IDs, attributes and group memberships. Identity sources provide identity (ID) tokens and access tokens. Verified Permissions derives information about your user and session from token claims. Access tokens provide action context to your policies, and ID tokens provide principal Attributes.",

This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you use a UUID type of value.. If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you. If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an ConflictException error. Verified Permissions recognizes a ClientToken for eight hours. After eight hours, the next request with the same parameters performs the operation again regardless of the value of ClientToken. This field is autopopulated if not provided.",
