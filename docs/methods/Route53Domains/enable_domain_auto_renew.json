  "description": "This operation configures Amazon Route 53 to automatically renew the specified domain before the domain registration expires. The cost of renewing your domain registration is billed to your Amazon Web Services account. The period during which you can renew a domain name varies by TLD. For a list of TLDs and their renewal policies, see Domains That You Can Register with Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Route 53 requires that you renew before the end of the renewal period so we can complete processing before the deadline.",
