  "description": "Deleting a Global datastore is a two-step process: Since the Global Datastore has only a primary cluster, you can delete the Global Datastore while retaining the primary by setting RetainPrimaryReplicationGroup=true. The primary cluster is never deleted when deleting a Global Datastore. It can only be deleted when it no longer is associated with any Global Datastore. When you receive a successful response from this operation, Amazon ElastiCache immediately begins deleting the selected resources; you cannot cancel or revert this operation.",
