  "description": "TerminateJobFlows shuts a list of clusters (job flows) down. When a job flow is shut down, any step not yet completed is canceled and the Amazon EC2 instances on which the cluster is running are stopped. Any log files not already saved are uploaded to Amazon S3 if a LogUri was specified when the cluster was created. The maximum number of clusters allowed is 10. The call to TerminateJobFlows is asynchronous. Depending on the configuration of the cluster, it may take up to 1-5 minutes for the cluster to completely terminate and release allocated resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances.",
