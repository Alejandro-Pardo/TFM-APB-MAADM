When true, IAM principals in the Amazon Web Services account can perform Amazon EMR cluster actions that their IAM policies allow. When false, only the IAM principal that created the cluster and the Amazon Web Services account root user can perform Amazon EMR actions on the cluster, regardless of IAM permissions policies attached to other IAM principals. This action works on running clusters. When you create a cluster, use the  RunJobFlowInput$VisibleToAllUsers parameter.
