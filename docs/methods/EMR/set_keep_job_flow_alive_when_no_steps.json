  "description": "You can use the SetKeepJobFlowAliveWhenNoSteps to configure a cluster (job flow) to terminate after the step execution, i.e., all your steps are executed. If you want a transient cluster that shuts down after the last of the current executing steps are completed, you can configure SetKeepJobFlowAliveWhenNoSteps to false. If you want a long running cluster, configure SetKeepJobFlowAliveWhenNoSteps to true. For more information, see Managing Cluster Termination in the Amazon EMR Management Guide.",
