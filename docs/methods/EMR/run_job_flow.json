  "description": "RunJobFlow creates and starts running a new cluster (job flow). The cluster runs the steps specified. After the steps complete, the cluster stops and the HDFS partition is lost. To prevent loss of data, configure the last step of the job flow to store results in Amazon S3. If the  JobFlowInstancesConfig KeepJobFlowAliveWhenNoSteps parameter is set to TRUE, the cluster transitions to the WAITING state rather than shutting down after the steps have completed. For additional protection, you can set the  JobFlowInstancesConfig TerminationProtected parameter to TRUE to lock the cluster and prevent it from being terminated by API call, user intervention, or in the event of a job flow error. A maximum of 256 steps are allowed in each job flow. If your cluster is long-running (such as a Hive data warehouse) or complex, you may require more than 256 steps to process your data. You can bypass the 256-step limitation in various ways, including using the SSH shell to connect to the master node and submitting queries directly to the software running on the master node, such as Hive and Hadoop. For long-running clusters, we recommend that you periodically store your results.",

The type of adjustment the automatic scaling activity makes when triggered, and the periodicity of the adjustment. AdjustmentType (string) --- The way in which Amazon EC2 instances are added (if ScalingAdjustment is a positive number) or terminated (if ScalingAdjustment is a negative number) each time the scaling activity is triggered. CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY is the default. CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY indicates that the Amazon EC2 instance count increments or decrements by ScalingAdjustment, which should be expressed as an integer. PERCENT_CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY indicates the instance count increments or decrements by the percentage specified by ScalingAdjustment, which should be expressed as an integer. For example, 20 indicates an increase in 20% increments of cluster capacity. EXACT_CAPACITY indicates the scaling activity results in an instance group with the number of Amazon EC2 instances specified by ScalingAdjustment, which should be expressed as a positive integer. The amount by which to scale in or scale out, based on the specified AdjustmentType. A positive value adds to the instance group's Amazon EC2 instance count while a negative number removes instances. If AdjustmentType is set to EXACT_CAPACITY, the number should only be a positive integer. If AdjustmentType is set to PERCENT_CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY, the value should express the percentage as an integer. For example, -20 indicates a decrease in 20% increments of cluster capacity. CoolDown (integer) --- The amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes before any further trigger-related scaling activities can start. The default value is 0. The CloudWatch alarm definition that determines when automatic scaling activity is triggered. The definition of a CloudWatch metric alarm.

Statistic (string) --- The statistic to apply to the metric associated with the alarm. The default is AVERAGE. The value against which the specified statistic is compared. Unit (string) --- The unit of measure associated with the CloudWatch metric being watched. The value specified for Unit must correspond to the units specified in the CloudWatch metric. Dimensions (list) --- A CloudWatch metric dimension. (dict) --- A CloudWatch dimension, which is specified using a Key (known as a Name in CloudWatch), Value pair. By default, Amazon EMR uses one dimension whose Key is JobFlowID and Value is a variable representing the cluster ID, which is ${emr.clusterId}. This enables the rule to bootstrap when the cluster ID becomes available. Key (string) --- The dimension name. Value (string) --- The dimension value. CustomAmiId (string) --- The custom AMI ID to use for the provisioned instance group. InstanceFleets (list) --- Describes the Amazon EC2 instances and instance configurations for clusters that use the instance fleet configuration.

Valid values are MASTER, CORE, and TASK. TargetOnDemandCapacity (integer) --- The target capacity of On-Demand units for the instance fleet, which determines how many On-Demand Instances to provision. When the instance fleet launches, Amazon EMR tries to provision On-Demand Instances as specified by  InstanceTypeConfig. Each instance configuration has a specified WeightedCapacity. When an On-Demand Instance is provisioned, the WeightedCapacity units count toward the target capacity. Amazon EMR provisions instances until the target capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are 2 units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EMR can only provision an instance with a WeightedCapacity of 5 units, the instance is provisioned, and the target capacity is exceeded by 3 units. TargetSpotCapacity (integer) --- The target capacity of Spot units for the instance fleet, which determines how many Spot Instances to provision. When the instance fleet launches, Amazon EMR tries to provision Spot Instances as specified by  InstanceTypeConfig. When a Spot Instance is provisioned, the WeightedCapacity units count toward the target capacity. InstanceTypeConfigs (list) --- The instance type configurations that define the Amazon EC2 instances in the instance fleet. (dict) --- An instance type configuration for each instance type in an instance fleet, which determines the Amazon EC2 instances Amazon EMR attempts to provision to fulfill On-Demand and Spot target capacities.

For more information about how to use an allocation strategy, see Configure Instance Fleets. Without an allocation strategy, you may specify a maximum of five instance type configurations for a fleet. An Amazon EC2 instance type, such as m3.xlarge. WeightedCapacity (integer) --- The number of units that a provisioned instance of this type provides toward fulfilling the target capacities defined in  InstanceFleetConfig. This value is 1 for a master instance fleet, and must be 1 or greater for core and task instance fleets. Defaults to 1 if not specified. BidPrice (string) --- The bid price for each Amazon EC2 Spot Instance type as defined by InstanceType. Expressed in USD.

SpotSpecification (dict) --- The launch specification for Spot instances in the fleet, which determines the allocation strategy, defined duration, and provisioning timeout behavior. The Spot provisioning timeout period in minutes. If Spot Instances are not provisioned within this time period, the TimeOutAction is taken. Minimum value is 5 and maximum value is 1440. The timeout applies only during initial provisioning, when the cluster is first created. The action to take when TargetSpotCapacity has not been fulfilled when the TimeoutDurationMinutes has expired; that is, when all Spot Instances could not be provisioned within the Spot provisioning timeout. Valid values are TERMINATE_CLUSTER and SWITCH_TO_ON_DEMAND. SWITCH_TO_ON_DEMAND specifies that if no Spot Instances are available, On-Demand Instances should be provisioned to fulfill any remaining Spot capacity. BlockDurationMinutes (integer) --- The defined duration for Spot Instances (also known as Spot blocks) in minutes. When specified, the Spot Instance does not terminate before the defined duration expires, and defined duration pricing for Spot Instances applies. Valid values are 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360. The duration period starts as soon as a Spot Instance receives its instance ID. At the end of the duration, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot Instance for termination and provides a Spot Instance termination notice, which gives the instance a two-minute warning before it terminates. AllocationStrategy (string) --- Specifies one of the following strategies to launch Spot Instance fleets: capacity-optimized, price-capacity-optimized, lowest-price, or diversified, and capacity-optimized-prioritized. For more information on the provisioning strategies, see Allocation strategies for Spot Instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. OnDemandSpecification (dict) --- The launch specification for On-Demand Instances in the instance fleet, which determines the allocation strategy and capacity reservation options. Specifies the strategy to use in launching On-Demand instance fleets. Available options are lowest-price and prioritized. lowest-price specifies to launch the instances with the lowest price first, and prioritized specifies that Amazon EMR should launch the instances with the highest priority first. The default is lowest-price. CapacityReservationOptions (dict) --- The launch specification for On-Demand instances in the instance fleet, which determines the allocation strategy. UsageStrategy (string) --- Indicates whether to use unused Capacity Reservations for fulfilling On-Demand capacity. If you specify use-capacity-reservations-first, the fleet uses unused Capacity Reservations to fulfill On-Demand capacity up to the target On-Demand capacity. If multiple instance pools have unused Capacity Reservations, the On-Demand allocation strategy ( lowest-price) is applied. If the number of unused Capacity Reservations is less than the On-Demand target capacity, the remaining On-Demand target capacity is launched according to the On-Demand allocation strategy ( lowest-price). If you do not specify a value, the fleet fulfills the On-Demand capacity according to the chosen On-Demand allocation strategy. CapacityReservationPreference (string) --- Indicates the instance's Capacity Reservation preferences. Possible preferences include: open - The instance can run in any open Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone). none - The instance avoids running in a Capacity Reservation even if one is available. The instance runs as an On-Demand Instance. CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn (string) --- The ARN of the Capacity Reservation resource group in which to run the instance. ResizeSpecifications (dict) --- The resize specification for the instance fleet. SpotResizeSpecification (dict) --- The resize specification for Spot Instances in the instance fleet, which contains the allocation strategy and the resize timeout period. TimeoutDurationMinutes (integer) --- Spot resize timeout in minutes. If Spot Instances are not provisioned within this time, the resize workflow will stop provisioning of Spot instances. Minimum value is 5 minutes and maximum value is 10,080 minutes (7 days). The timeout applies to all resize workflows on the Instance Fleet. The resize could be triggered by Amazon EMR Managed Scaling or by the customer (via Amazon EMR Console, Amazon EMR CLI modify-instance-fleet or Amazon EMR SDK ModifyInstanceFleet API) or by Amazon EMR due to Amazon EC2 Spot Reclamation. AllocationStrategy (string) --- Specifies the allocation strategy to use to launch Spot instances during a resize. If you run Amazon EMR releases 6.9.0 or higher, the default is price-capacity-optimized. If you run Amazon EMR releases 6.8.0 or lower, the default is capacity-optimized.

Valid inputs are '0.18' (no longer maintained), '0.20' (no longer maintained), '0.20.205' (no longer maintained), '1.0.3', '2.2.0', or '2.4.0'. If you do not set this value, the default of 0.18 is used, unless the AmiVersion parameter is set in the RunJobFlow call, in which case the default version of Hadoop for that AMI version is used. Ec2SubnetId (string) --- Applies to clusters that use the uniform instance group configuration. To launch the cluster in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), set this parameter to the identifier of the Amazon VPC subnet where you want the cluster to launch. If you do not specify this value and your account supports EC2-Classic, the cluster launches in EC2-Classic. Ec2SubnetIds (list) --- Applies to clusters that use the instance fleet configuration.
