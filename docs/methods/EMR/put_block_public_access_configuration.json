      "description": "A configuration for Amazon EMR block public access. The configuration applies to all clusters created in your account for the current Region. The configuration specifies whether block public access is enabled. If block public access is enabled, security groups associated with the cluster cannot have rules that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 on a port, unless the port is specified as an exception using PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges in the BlockPublicAccessConfiguration. By default, Port 22 (SSH) is an exception, and public access is allowed on this port. You can change this by updating BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules to remove the exception. BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules (boolean) --- Indicates whether Amazon EMR block public access is enabled ( true) or disabled ( false). By default, the value is false for accounts that have created Amazon EMR clusters before July 2019. For accounts created after this, the default is true. PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges (list) --- Specifies ports and port ranges that are permitted to have security group rules that allow inbound traffic from all public sources. For example, if Port 23 (Telnet) is specified for PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges, Amazon EMR allows cluster creation if a security group associated with the cluster has a rule that allows inbound traffic on Port 23 from IPv4 0.0.0.0/0 or IPv6 port ::/0 as the source. By default, Port 22, which is used for SSH access to the cluster Amazon EC2 instances, is in the list of PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges. (dict) --- A list of port ranges that are permitted to allow inbound traffic from all public IP addresses. To specify a single port, use the same value for MinRange and MaxRange. MinRange (integer) --- The smallest port number in a specified range of port numbers. MaxRange (integer) --- The smallest port number in a specified range of port numbers.",
