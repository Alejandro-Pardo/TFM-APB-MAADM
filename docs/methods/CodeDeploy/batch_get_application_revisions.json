GitHub: An application revision stored in GitHub (EC2/On-premises deployments only). String: A YAML-formatted or JSON-formatted string (Lambda deployments only). AppSpecContent: An AppSpecContent object that contains the contents of an AppSpec file for an Lambda or Amazon ECS deployment. The content is formatted as JSON or YAML stored as a RawString. s3Location (dict) --- Information about the location of a revision stored in Amazon S3. bucket (string) --- The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where the application revision is stored. key (string) --- The name of the Amazon S3 object that represents the bundled artifacts for the application revision. bundleType (string) --- The file type of the application revision. Must be one of the following: tar: A tar archive file. tgz: A compressed tar archive file. zip: A zip archive file. YAML: A YAML-formatted file. JSON: A JSON-formatted file. version (string) --- A specific version of the Amazon S3 object that represents the bundled artifacts for the application revision.

It includes information about which Lambda function to update and optional Lambda functions that validate deployment lifecycle events. sha256 (string) --- The SHA256 hash value of the revision content. appSpecContent (dict) --- The content of an AppSpec file for an Lambda or Amazon ECS deployment. The content is formatted as JSON or YAML and stored as a RawString. For an Lambda deployment, the content includes a Lambda function name, the alias for its original version, and the alias for its replacement version. The deployment shifts traffic from the original version of the Lambda function to the replacement version. For an Amazon ECS deployment, the content includes the task name, information about the load balancer that serves traffic to the container, and more.
