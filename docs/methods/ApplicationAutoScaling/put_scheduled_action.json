  "description": "Creates or updates a scheduled action for an Application Auto Scaling scalable target. Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID, and scalable dimension. A scheduled action applies to the scalable target identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scheduled action until you have registered the resource as a scalable target. When you specify start and end times with a recurring schedule using a cron expression or rates, they form the boundaries for when the recurring action starts and stops. To update a scheduled action, specify the parameters that you want to change. If you don't specify start and end times, the old values are deleted. For more information, see Scheduled scaling in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.",

The following formats are supported: At expressions - ' at(yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss)' Rate expressions - ' rate(value unit)' Cron expressions - ' cron(fields)' At expressions are useful for one-time schedules. Cron expressions are useful for scheduled actions that run periodically at a specified date and time, and rate expressions are useful for scheduled actions that run at a regular interval. At and cron expressions use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) by default. The cron format consists of six fields separated by white spaces: [Minutes] [Hours] [Day_of_Month] [Month] [Day_of_Week] [Year]. For rate expressions, value is a positive integer and unit is minute | minutes | hour | hours | day | days.
