  "description": "Adds or edits tags on an Application Auto Scaling scalable target. Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value, which are both case-sensitive strings. To add a tag, specify a new tag key and a tag value. To edit a tag, specify an existing tag key and a new tag value. You can use this operation to tag an Application Auto Scaling scalable target, but you cannot tag a scaling policy or scheduled action. You can also add tags to an Application Auto Scaling scalable target while creating it ( RegisterScalableTarget). For general information about tags, including the format and syntax, see Tagging your Amazon Web Services resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. Use tags to control access to a scalable target. For more information, see Tagging support for Application Auto Scaling in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.",
