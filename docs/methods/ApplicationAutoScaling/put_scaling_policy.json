  "description": "Creates or updates a scaling policy for an Application Auto Scaling scalable target. Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID, and scalable dimension. A scaling policy applies to the scalable target identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scaling policy until you have registered the resource as a scalable target. Multiple scaling policies can be in force at the same time for the same scalable target. You can have one or more target tracking scaling policies, one or more step scaling policies, or both. However, there is a chance that multiple policies could conflict, instructing the scalable target to scale out or in at the same time. Application Auto Scaling gives precedence to the policy that provides the largest capacity for both scale out and scale in. For example, if one policy increases capacity by 3, another policy increases capacity by 200 percent, and the current capacity is 10, Application Auto Scaling uses the policy with the highest calculated capacity (200% of 10 = 20) and scales out to 30. We recommend caution, however, when using target tracking scaling policies with step scaling policies because conflicts between these policies can cause undesirable behavior. For example, if the step scaling policy initiates a scale-in activity before the target tracking policy is ready to scale in, the scale-in activity will not be blocked. After the scale-in activity completes, the target tracking policy could instruct the scalable target to scale out again. For more information, see Target tracking scaling policies, Step scaling policies, and Predictive scaling policies in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.",

AdjustmentType (string) --- Specifies how the ScalingAdjustment value in a StepAdjustment is interpreted (for example, an absolute number or a percentage). The valid values are ChangeInCapacity, ExactCapacity, and PercentChangeInCapacity. AdjustmentType is required if you are adding a new step scaling policy configuration. StepAdjustments (list) --- A set of adjustments that enable you to scale based on the size of the alarm breach. At least one step adjustment is required if you are adding a new step scaling policy configuration. (dict) --- Represents a step adjustment for a StepScalingPolicyConfiguration. Describes an adjustment based on the difference between the value of the aggregated CloudWatch metric and the breach threshold that you've defined for the alarm. For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach threshold of 50: To initiate the adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 60, specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10. To initiate the adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50, specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0. There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy: The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap. At most one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound. At most one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one step adjustment has a positive upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound. The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment. MetricIntervalLowerBound (float) --- The lower bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric. If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the lower bound is inclusive (the metric must be greater than or equal to the threshold plus the lower bound). Otherwise, it's exclusive (the metric must be greater than the threshold plus the lower bound). A null value indicates negative infinity. MetricIntervalUpperBound (float) --- The upper bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric. If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the upper bound is exclusive (the metric must be less than the threshold plus the upper bound). Otherwise, it's inclusive (the metric must be less than or equal to the threshold plus the upper bound). A null value indicates positive infinity. The upper bound must be greater than the lower bound. The amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjustment type. A positive value adds to the current capacity while a negative number removes from the current capacity. For exact capacity, you must specify a non-negative value. MinAdjustmentMagnitude (integer) --- The minimum value to scale by when the adjustment type is PercentChangeInCapacity. For example, suppose that you create a step scaling policy to scale out an Amazon ECS service by 25 percent and you specify a MinAdjustmentMagnitude of 2. If the service has 4 tasks and the scaling policy is performed, 25 percent of 4 is 1. However, because you specified a MinAdjustmentMagnitude of 2, Application Auto Scaling scales out the service by 2 tasks. Cooldown (integer) --- The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a previous scaling activity to take effect. If not specified, the default value is 300. For more information, see Cooldown period in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide. MetricAggregationType (string) --- The aggregation type for the CloudWatch metrics.

Unit (string) --- The unit of the metric. For a complete list of the units that CloudWatch supports, see the MetricDatum data type in the Amazon CloudWatch API Reference. Metrics (list) --- The metrics to include in the target tracking scaling policy, as a metric data query. This can include both raw metric and metric math expressions. (dict) --- The metric data to return. Also defines whether this call is returning data for one metric only, or whether it is performing a math expression on the values of returned metric statistics to create a new time series. A time series is a series of data points, each of which is associated with a timestamp. For more information and examples, see Create a target tracking scaling policy for Application Auto Scaling using metric math in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide. Expression (string) --- The math expression to perform on the returned data, if this object is performing a math expression. This expression can use the Id of the other metrics to refer to those metrics, and can also use the Id of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. Conditional: Within each TargetTrackingMetricDataQuery object, you must specify either Expression or MetricStat, but not both. A short name that identifies the object's results in the response. This name must be unique among all MetricDataQuery objects specified for a single scaling policy. If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscores. The first character must be a lowercase letter. Label (string) --- A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is a math expression, so that you know what the value represents. MetricStat (dict) --- Information about the metric data to return. Conditional: Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either Expression or MetricStat, but not both. The CloudWatch metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions. To get the exact metric name, namespace, and dimensions, inspect the Metric object that is returned by a call to ListMetrics. Dimensions (list) --- The dimensions for the metric.

(dict) --- Describes the dimension of a metric. For more information, see the table in Amazon Web Services services that publish CloudWatch metrics in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic. For a list of valid values, see the table in Statistics in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. The most commonly used metric for scaling is Average. Unit (string) --- The unit to use for the returned data points. ReturnData (boolean) --- Indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you use any math expressions, specify true for this value for only the final math expression that the metric specification is based on. You must specify false for ReturnData for all the other metrics and expressions used in the metric specification. If you are only retrieving metrics and not performing any math expressions, do not specify anything for ReturnData. This sets it to its default ( true). ScaleOutCooldown (integer) --- The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a previous scale-out activity to take effect. For more information and for default values, see Define cooldown periods in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide. ScaleInCooldown (integer) --- The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale-in activity completes before another scale-in activity can start. DisableScaleIn (boolean) --- Indicates whether scale in by the target tracking scaling policy is disabled. If the value is true, scale in is disabled and the target tracking scaling policy won't remove capacity from the scalable target. Otherwise, scale in is enabled and the target tracking scaling policy can remove capacity from the scalable target. The default value is false.",

(dict) --- This structure specifies the metrics and target utilization settings for a predictive scaling policy. You must specify either a metric pair, or a load metric and a scaling metric individually. Specifying a metric pair instead of individual metrics provides a simpler way to configure metrics for a scaling policy. You choose the metric pair, and the policy automatically knows the correct sum and average statistics to use for the load metric and the scaling metric. Specifies the target utilization. PredefinedMetricPairSpecification (dict) --- The predefined metric pair specification that determines the appropriate scaling metric and load metric to use. Indicates which metrics to use. There are two different types of metrics for each metric type: one is a load metric and one is a scaling metric. ResourceLabel (string) --- A label that uniquely identifies a specific target group from which to determine the total and average request count. PredefinedScalingMetricSpecification (dict) --- The predefined scaling metric specification. The metric type.

If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscores. The first character must be a lowercase letter. Expression (string) --- The math expression to perform on the returned data, if this object is performing a math expression. This expression can use the Id of the other metrics to refer to those metrics, and can also use the Id of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. Conditional: Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either Expression or MetricStat, but not both. MetricStat (dict) --- Information about the metric data to return. The CloudWatch metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions. To get the exact metric name, namespace, and dimensions, inspect the Metric object that is returned by a call to ListMetrics. Dimensions (list) --- Describes the dimensions of the metric. (dict) --- Describes the dimension of a metric. The name of the dimension. The value of the dimension. MetricName (string) --- The name of the metric. Namespace (string) --- The namespace of the metric. The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic. For a list of valid values, see the table in Statistics in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. The most commonly used metrics for predictive scaling are Average and Sum. Unit (string) --- The unit to use for the returned data points. For a complete list of the units that CloudWatch supports, see the MetricDatum data type in the Amazon CloudWatch API Reference. Label (string) --- A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is a math expression, so that you know what the value represents. ReturnData (boolean) --- Indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric.

The value must be less than the forecast interval duration of 3600 seconds (60 minutes). Defaults to 300 seconds if not specified. MaxCapacityBreachBehavior (string) --- Defines the behavior that should be applied if the forecast capacity approaches or exceeds the maximum capacity. Defaults to HonorMaxCapacity if not specified. MaxCapacityBuffer (integer) --- The size of the capacity buffer to use when the forecast capacity is close to or exceeds the maximum capacity. The value is specified as a percentage relative to the forecast capacity. For example, if the buffer is 10, this means a 10 percent buffer, such that if the forecast capacity is 50, and the maximum capacity is 40, then the effective maximum capacity is 55.
