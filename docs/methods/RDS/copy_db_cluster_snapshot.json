To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot, SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB cluster snapshot. You can copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region. In that case, the Amazon Web Services Region where you call the CopyDBClusterSnapshot operation is the destination Amazon Web Services Region for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied to. To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region, you must provide the following values: To cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the target DB cluster snapshot identified by TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier while that DB cluster snapshot is in 'copying' status. For more information on copying encrypted Amazon Aurora DB cluster snapshots from one Amazon Web Services Region to another, see Copying a Snapshot in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

Don't specify PreSignedUrl when copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot in the same Amazon Web Services Region. This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions. The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBClusterSnapshot API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to copy. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values: KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the CopyDBClusterSnapshot operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL. DestinationRegion - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in. SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115.
