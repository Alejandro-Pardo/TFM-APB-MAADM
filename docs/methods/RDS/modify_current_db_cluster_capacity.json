  "description": "Set the capacity of an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster to a specific value. Aurora Serverless v1 scales seamlessly based on the workload on the DB cluster. In some cases, the capacity might not scale fast enough to meet a sudden change in workload, such as a large number of new transactions. Call ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity to set the capacity explicitly. After this call sets the DB cluster capacity, Aurora Serverless v1 can automatically scale the DB cluster based on the cooldown period for scaling up and the cooldown period for scaling down. For more information about Aurora Serverless v1, see Using Amazon Aurora Serverless v1 in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.",
