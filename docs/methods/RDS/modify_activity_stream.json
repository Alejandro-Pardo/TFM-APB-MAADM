If your activity stream is started and locked, you can unlock it, customize your audit policy, and then lock your activity stream. Restarting the activity stream isn't required. For more information, see Modifying a database activity stream in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This operation is supported for RDS for Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.",
