You must explicitly create the writer instance for your DB cluster using the CreateDBInstance operation. If you create a Multi-AZ DB cluster, the request creates a writer and two reader DB instances for you, each in a different Availability Zone. You can use the ReplicationSourceIdentifier parameter to create an Amazon Aurora DB cluster as a read replica of another DB cluster or Amazon RDS for MySQL or PostgreSQL DB instance. For more information about Amazon Aurora, see What is Amazon Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. You can also use the ReplicationSourceIdentifier parameter to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster read replica with an RDS for MySQL or PostgreSQL DB instance as the source.
