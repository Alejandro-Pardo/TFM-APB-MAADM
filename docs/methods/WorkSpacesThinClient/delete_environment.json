This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you use a UUID type of value. If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you. If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an IdempotentParameterMismatch error. This field is autopopulated if not provided.",
