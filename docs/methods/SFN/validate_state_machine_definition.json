  "description": "Validates the syntax of a state machine definition specified in Amazon States Language (ASL), a JSON-based, structured language. You can validate that a state machine definition is correct without creating a state machine resource. Suggested uses for ValidateStateMachineDefinition: Validation will look for problems in your state machine definition and return a result and a list of diagnostic elements. The result value will be OK when your workflow definition can be successfully created or updated. Note the result can be OK even when diagnostic warnings are present in the response. The result value will be FAIL when the workflow definition contains errors that would prevent you from creating or updating your state machine. The list of ValidateStateMachineDefinitionDiagnostic data elements can contain zero or more WARNING and/or ERROR elements.",
