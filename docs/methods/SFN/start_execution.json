The following are some examples of qualified and unqualified state machine ARNs: If you start an execution with an unqualified state machine ARN, Step Functions uses the latest revision of the state machine for the execution. To start executions of a state machine version, call StartExecution and provide the version ARN or the ARN of an alias that points to the version.",
