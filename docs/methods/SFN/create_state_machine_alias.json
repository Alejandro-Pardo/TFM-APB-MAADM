  "description": "Creates an alias for a state machine that points to one or two versions of the same state machine. You can set your application to call  StartExecution with an alias and update the version the alias uses without changing the client's code. You can also map an alias to split  StartExecution requests between two versions of a state machine. To do this, add a second RoutingConfig object in the routingConfiguration parameter. You must also specify the percentage of execution run requests each version should receive in both RoutingConfig objects. Step Functions randomly chooses which version runs a given execution based on the percentage you specify. To create an alias that points to a single version, specify a single RoutingConfig object with a weight set to 100. You can create up to 100 aliases for each state machine. You must delete unused aliases using the  DeleteStateMachineAlias API action. CreateStateMachineAlias is an idempotent API. Step Functions bases the idempotency check on the stateMachineArn, description, name, and routingConfiguration parameters. Requests that contain the same values for these parameters return a successful idempotent response without creating a duplicate resource.",
