  "description": "Lists all executions of a state machine or a Map Run. You can list all executions related to a state machine by specifying a state machine Amazon Resource Name (ARN), or those related to a Map Run by specifying a Map Run ARN. Using this API action, you can also list all redriven executions. You can also provide a state machine alias ARN or version ARN to list the executions associated with a specific alias or version. Results are sorted by time, with the most recent execution first. If nextToken is returned, there are more results available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an HTTP 400 InvalidToken error. This API action is not supported by EXPRESS state machines.",
