  "description": "Provides information about a state machine execution, such as the state machine associated with the execution, the execution input and output, and relevant execution metadata. If you've redriven an execution, you can use this API action to return information about the redrives of that execution. In addition, you can use this API action to return the Map Run Amazon Resource Name (ARN) if the execution was dispatched by a Map Run. If you specify a version or alias ARN when you call the  StartExecution API action, DescribeExecution returns that ARN. Executions of an EXPRESS state machine aren't supported by DescribeExecution unless a Map Run dispatched them.",
