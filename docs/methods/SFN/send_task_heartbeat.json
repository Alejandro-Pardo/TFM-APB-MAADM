  "description": "Used by activity workers and Task states using the callback pattern, and optionally Task states using the job run pattern to report to Step Functions that the task represented by the specified taskToken is still making progress. This action resets the Heartbeat clock. The Heartbeat threshold is specified in the state machine's Amazon States Language definition ( HeartbeatSeconds). This action does not in itself create an event in the execution history. However, if the task times out, the execution history contains an ActivityTimedOut entry for activities, or a TaskTimedOut entry for tasks using the job run or callback pattern.",
