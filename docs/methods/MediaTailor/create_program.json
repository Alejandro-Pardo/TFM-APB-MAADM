Accepted value: SPLICE_INSERT, TIME_SIGNAL. How long (in milliseconds) after the beginning of the program that an ad starts. This value must fall within 100ms of a segment boundary, otherwise the ad break will be skipped. Slate (dict) --- Ad break slate configuration. SourceLocationName (string) --- The name of the source location where the slate VOD source is stored. VodSourceName (string) --- The slate VOD source name. The VOD source must already exist in a source location before it can be used for slate. SpliceInsertMessage (dict) --- This defines the SCTE-35 splice_insert() message inserted around the ad. For information about using splice_insert(), see the SCTE-35 specficiaiton, section 9.7.3.1. AvailNum (integer) --- This is written to splice_insert.avail_num, as defined in section 9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35 specification. The default value is 0. Values must be between 0 and 256, inclusive. AvailsExpected (integer) --- This is written to splice_insert.avails_expected, as defined in section 9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35 specification. SpliceEventId (integer) --- This is written to splice_insert.splice_event_id, as defined in section 9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35 specification. The default value is 1. UniqueProgramId (integer) --- This is written to splice_insert.unique_program_id, as defined in section 9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35 specification. TimeSignalMessage (dict) --- Defines the SCTE-35 time_signal message inserted around the ad. Programs on a channel's schedule can be configured with one or more ad breaks. You can attach a splice_insert SCTE-35 message to the ad break. This message provides basic metadata about the ad break. See section 9.7.4 of the 2022 SCTE-35 specification for more information. SegmentationDescriptors (list) --- The configurations for the SCTE-35 segmentation_descriptor message(s) sent with the time_signal message. (dict) --- The segmentation_descriptor message can contain advanced metadata fields, like content identifiers, to convey a wide range of information about the ad break. MediaTailor writes the ad metadata in the egress manifest as part of the EXT-X-DATERANGE or EventStream ad marker's SCTE-35 data. segmentation_descriptor messages must be sent with the time_signal message type. See the segmentation_descriptor() table of the 2022 SCTE-35 specification for more information.

The default value is 14. SegmentationUpid (string) --- The Upid to assign to the segmentation_descriptor.segmentation_upid message, as defined in section 10.3.3.1 of the 2022 SCTE-35 specification. The value must be a hexadecimal string containing only the characters 0 though 9 and A through F. The default value is '' (an empty string). SegmentationTypeId (integer) --- The Type Identifier to assign to the segmentation_descriptor.segmentation_type_id message, as defined in section 10.3.3.1 of the 2022 SCTE-35 specification.

SegmentsExpected (integer) --- The number of segments expected, which is assigned to the segmentation_descriptor.segments_expectedS message, as defined in section 10.3.3.1 of the 2022 SCTE-35 specification Values must be between 0 and 256, inclusive. SubSegmentNum (integer) --- The sub-segment number to assign to the segmentation_descriptor.sub_segment_num message, as defined in section 10.3.3.1 of the 2022 SCTE-35 specification. The defualt value is null. SubSegmentsExpected (integer) --- The number of sub-segments expected, which is assigned to the segmentation_descriptor.sub_segments_expected message, as defined in section 10.3.3.1 of the 2022 SCTE-35 specification. The default value is null. AdBreakMetadata (list) --- Defines a list of key/value pairs that MediaTailor generates within the EXT-X-ASSET``tag for ``SCTE35_ENHANCED output. (dict) --- For SCTE35_ENHANCED output, defines a key and corresponding value. MediaTailor generates these pairs within the ``EXT-X-ASSET``tag. For SCTE35_ENHANCED output, defines a key. MediaTailor takes this key, and its associated value, and generates the key/value pair within the ``EXT-X-ASSET``tag. If you specify a key, you must also specify a corresponding value.

The defualt value is null. SubSegmentsExpected (integer) --- The number of sub-segments expected, which is assigned to the segmentation_descriptor.sub_segments_expected message, as defined in section 10.3.3.1 of the 2022 SCTE-35 specification. The default value is null. AdBreakMetadata (list) --- Defines a list of key/value pairs that MediaTailor generates within the EXT-X-ASSET``tag for ``SCTE35_ENHANCED output. (dict) --- For SCTE35_ENHANCED output, defines a key and corresponding value. MediaTailor generates these pairs within the ``EXT-X-ASSET``tag. For SCTE35_ENHANCED output, defines a key. MediaTailor takes this key, and its associated value, and generates the key/value pair within the ``EXT-X-ASSET``tag. If you specify a key, you must also specify a corresponding value. For SCTE35_ENHANCED output, defines a value. MediaTailor; takes this value, and its associated key, and generates the key/value pair within the ``EXT-X-ASSET``tag. If you specify a value, you must also specify a corresponding key. DurationMillis (integer) --- The duration of the alternateMedia in milliseconds.",
