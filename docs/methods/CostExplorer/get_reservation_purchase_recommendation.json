  "description": "Gets recommendations for reservation purchases. These recommendations might help you to reduce your costs. Reservations provide a discounted hourly rate (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing. Amazon Web Services generates your recommendations by identifying your On-Demand usage during a specific time period and collecting your usage into categories that are eligible for a reservation. After Amazon Web Services has these categories, it simulates every combination of reservations in each category of usage to identify the best number of each type of Reserved Instance (RI) to purchase to maximize your estimated savings. For example, Amazon Web Services automatically aggregates your Amazon EC2 Linux, shared tenancy, and c4 family usage in the US West (Oregon) Region and recommends that you buy size-flexible regional reservations to apply to the c4 family usage. Amazon Web Services recommends the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to purchase a size-flexible Reserved Instance (RI). Amazon Web Services also shows the equal number of normalized units. This way, you can purchase any instance size that you want. For this example, your RI recommendation is for c4.large because that is the smallest size instance in the c4 instance family.",

      "description": "Use Expression to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs. Not all Expression types are supported in each API. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported. There are two patterns: Simple dimension values. There are three types of simple dimension values: CostCategories, Tags, and Dimensions. Specify the CostCategories field to define a filter that acts on Cost Categories. Specify the Tags field to define a filter that acts on Cost Allocation Tags. Specify the Dimensions field to define a filter that acts on the DimensionValues. For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can filter for REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1. For GetRightsizingRecommendation, the Region is a full name (for example, REGION==US East (N. Virginia). The corresponding Expression for this example is as follows: { \"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"REGION\", \"Values\": [ \"us-east-1\", \"us-west-1\" ] } } As shown in the previous example, lists of dimension values are combined with OR when applying the filter. You can also set different match options to further control how the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match options. For example, you can filter for linked account names that start with 'a'. The corresponding Expression for this example is as follows: { \"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME\", \"MatchOptions\": [ \"STARTS_WITH\" ], \"Values\": [ \"a\" ] } } Compound Expression types with logical operations. You can use multiple Expression types and the logical operators AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one or more Expression objects. By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options. For example, you can filter by ((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer). The corresponding Expression for this example is as follows: { \"And\": [ {\"Or\": [ {\"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"REGION\", \"Values\": [ \"us-east-1\", \"us-west-1\" ] }}, {\"Tags\": { \"Key\": \"TagName\", \"Values\": [\"Value1\"] } } ]}, {\"Not\": {\"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"USAGE_TYPE\", \"Values\": [\"DataTransfer\"] }}} ] } Or (list) --- Return results that match either Dimension object. (dict) --- Use Expression to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs. The corresponding Expression for this example is as follows: { \"And\": [ {\"Or\": [ {\"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"REGION\", \"Values\": [ \"us-east-1\", \"us-west-1\" ] }}, {\"Tags\": { \"Key\": \"TagName\", \"Values\": [\"Value1\"] } } ]}, {\"Not\": {\"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"USAGE_TYPE\", \"Values\": [\"DataTransfer\"] }}} ] } And (list) --- Return results that match both Dimension objects. The corresponding Expression for this example is as follows: { \"And\": [ {\"Or\": [ {\"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"REGION\", \"Values\": [ \"us-east-1\", \"us-west-1\" ] }}, {\"Tags\": { \"Key\": \"TagName\", \"Values\": [\"Value1\"] } } ]}, {\"Not\": {\"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"USAGE_TYPE\", \"Values\": [\"DataTransfer\"] }}} ] } Not (dict) --- Return results that don't match a Dimension object. Dimensions (dict) --- The specific Dimension to use for Expression. Key (string) --- The names of the metadata types that you can use to filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns a list of Availability Zones. Not all dimensions are supported in each API. LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME and SERVICE_CODE can only be used in CostCategoryRule. ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE and ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE can only be used in AnomalySubscriptions. Values (list) --- The metadata values that you can use to filter and group your results. You can use GetDimensionValues to find specific values. (string) --- MatchOptions (list) --- The match options that you can use to filter your results. MatchOptions is only applicable for actions related to Cost Category and Anomaly Subscriptions. The default values for MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE. (string) --- Tags (dict) --- The specific Tag to use for Expression. Key (string) --- The key for the tag. Values (list) --- The specific value of the tag. MatchOptions is only applicable for actions related to Cost Category. (string) --- CostCategories (dict) --- The filter that's based on CostCategory values. Key (string) --- The unique name of the Cost Category. Values (list) --- The specific value of the Cost Category. MatchOptions is only applicable for actions related to cost category. The default values for MatchOptions is EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE. (string) ---",
