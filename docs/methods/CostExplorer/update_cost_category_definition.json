      "description": "The Expression object used to categorize costs. For more information, see CostCategoryRule. (dict) --- Rules are processed in order. If there are multiple rules that match the line item, then the first rule to match is used to determine that Cost Category value. Value (string) --- The default value for the cost category. Rule (dict) --- An Expression object used to categorize costs. This supports dimensions, tags, and nested expressions. Currently the only dimensions supported are LINKED_ACCOUNT, SERVICE_CODE, RECORD_TYPE, LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME, REGION, and USAGE_TYPE. RECORD_TYPE is a dimension used for Cost Explorer APIs, and is also supported for Cost Category expressions. This dimension uses different terms, depending on whether you're using the console or API/JSON editor. For a detailed comparison, see Term Comparisons in the Billing and Cost Management User Guide. Or (list) --- Return results that match either Dimension object. (dict) --- Use Expression to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs. Not all Expression types are supported in each API. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported. There are two patterns: Simple dimension values. There are three types of simple dimension values: CostCategories, Tags, and Dimensions. Specify the CostCategories field to define a filter that acts on Cost Categories. Specify the Tags field to define a filter that acts on Cost Allocation Tags. Specify the Dimensions field to define a filter that acts on the DimensionValues. For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can filter for REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1. For GetRightsizingRecommendation, the Region is a full name (for example, REGION==US East (N. Virginia). The corresponding Expression for this example is as follows: { \"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"REGION\", \"Values\": [ \"us-east-1\", \"us-west-1\" ] } } As shown in the previous example, lists of dimension values are combined with OR when applying the filter. You can also set different match options to further control how the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match options. For example, you can filter for linked account names that start with 'a'. The corresponding Expression for this example is as follows: { \"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME\", \"MatchOptions\": [ \"STARTS_WITH\" ], \"Values\": [ \"a\" ] } } Compound Expression types with logical operations. You can use multiple Expression types and the logical operators AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one or more Expression objects. By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options. For example, you can filter by ((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer). The corresponding Expression for this example is as follows: { \"And\": [ {\"Or\": [ {\"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"REGION\", \"Values\": [ \"us-east-1\", \"us-west-1\" ] }}, {\"Tags\": { \"Key\": \"TagName\", \"Values\": [\"Value1\"] } } ]}, {\"Not\": {\"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"USAGE_TYPE\", \"Values\": [\"DataTransfer\"] }}} ] } And (list) --- Return results that match both Dimension objects. The corresponding Expression for this example is as follows: { \"And\": [ {\"Or\": [ {\"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"REGION\", \"Values\": [ \"us-east-1\", \"us-west-1\" ] }}, {\"Tags\": { \"Key\": \"TagName\", \"Values\": [\"Value1\"] } } ]}, {\"Not\": {\"Dimensions\": { \"Key\": \"USAGE_TYPE\", \"Values\": [\"DataTransfer\"] }}} ] } Not (dict) --- Return results that don't match a Dimension object. Dimensions (dict) --- The specific Dimension to use for Expression. Key (string) --- The names of the metadata types that you can use to filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns a list of Availability Zones. Not all dimensions are supported in each API. LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME and SERVICE_CODE can only be used in CostCategoryRule. ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE and ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE can only be used in AnomalySubscriptions. Values (list) --- The metadata values that you can use to filter and group your results. You can use GetDimensionValues to find specific values. (string) --- MatchOptions (list) --- The match options that you can use to filter your results. MatchOptions is only applicable for actions related to Cost Category and Anomaly Subscriptions. The default values for MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE. (string) --- Tags (dict) --- The specific Tag to use for Expression. Key (string) --- The key for the tag. Values (list) --- The specific value of the tag. MatchOptions is only applicable for actions related to Cost Category. (string) --- CostCategories (dict) --- The filter that's based on CostCategory values. Key (string) --- The unique name of the Cost Category. Values (list) --- The specific value of the Cost Category. MatchOptions is only applicable for actions related to cost category. The default values for MatchOptions is EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE. (string) --- InheritedValue (dict) --- The value the line item is categorized as if the line item contains the matched dimension. DimensionName (string) --- The name of the dimension that's used to group costs. If you specify LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME, the cost category value is based on account name. If you specify TAG, the cost category value is based on the value of the specified tag key. DimensionKey (string) --- The key to extract cost category values. Type (string) --- You can define the CostCategoryRule rule type as either REGULAR or INHERITED_VALUE. The INHERITED_VALUE rule type adds the flexibility to define a rule that dynamically inherits the cost category value. This value is from the dimension value that's defined by CostCategoryInheritedValueDimension. For example, suppose that you want to costs to be dynamically grouped based on the value of a specific tag key. First, choose an inherited value rule type, and then choose the tag dimension and specify the tag key to use.",
