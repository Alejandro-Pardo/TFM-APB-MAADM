  "description": "Creates a session to temporarily store conversations for generative AI (GenAI) applications built with open-source frameworks such as LangGraph and LlamaIndex. Sessions enable you to save the state of conversations at checkpoints, with the added security and infrastructure of Amazon Web Services. For more information, see Store and retrieve conversation history and context with Amazon Bedrock sessions. By default, Amazon Bedrock uses Amazon Web Services-managed keys for session encryption, including session metadata, or you can use your own KMS key. For more information, see Amazon Bedrock session encryption. Related APIs:",
