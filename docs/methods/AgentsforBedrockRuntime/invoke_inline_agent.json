The name of a metadata field to include in or exclude from consideration when reranking. fieldsToInclude (list) --- An array of objects, each of which specifies a metadata field to include in consideration when reranking. The remaining metadata fields are ignored. Contains configurations for the reranker model. additionalModelRequestFields (dict) --- A JSON object whose keys are request fields for the model and whose values are values for those fields. (string) --- (document) --- The ARN of the reranker model to use. numberOfRerankedResults (integer) --- The number of results to return after reranking. The type of reranker model. promptOverrideConfiguration (dict) --- Contains configurations to override prompt templates in different parts of an inline collaborator sequence. For more information, see Advanced prompts. overrideLambda (string) --- The ARN of the Lambda function to use when parsing the raw foundation model output in parts of the agent sequence. If you specify this field, at least one of the promptConfigurations must contain a parserMode value that is set to OVERRIDDEN. For more information, see Parser Lambda function in Amazon Bedrock Agents. Contains configurations to override a prompt template in one part of an agent sequence. (dict) --- Contains configurations to override a prompt template in one part of an agent sequence. additionalModelRequestFields (document) --- If the Converse or ConverseStream operations support the model, additionalModelRequestFields contains additional inference parameters, beyond the base set of inference parameters in the inferenceConfiguration field. For more information, see Inference request parameters and response fields for foundation models in the Amazon Bedrock user guide. basePromptTemplate (string) --- Defines the prompt template with which to replace the default prompt template. You can use placeholder variables in the base prompt template to customize the prompt. For more information, see Prompt template placeholder variables. For more information, see Configure the prompt templates. foundationModel (string) --- The foundation model to use. inferenceConfiguration (dict) --- Contains inference parameters to use when the agent invokes a foundation model in the part of the agent sequence defined by the promptType. For more information, see Inference parameters for foundation models. maximumLength (integer) --- The maximum number of tokens allowed in the generated response. stopSequences (list) --- A list of stop sequences. A stop sequence is a sequence of characters that causes the model to stop generating the response. (string) --- temperature (float) --- The likelihood of the model selecting higher-probability options while generating a response. A lower value makes the model more likely to choose higher-probability options, while a higher value makes the model more likely to choose lower-probability options. topK (integer) --- While generating a response, the model determines the probability of the following token at each point of generation. The value that you set for topK is the number of most-likely candidates from which the model chooses the next token in the sequence. For example, if you set topK to 50, the model selects the next token from among the top 50 most likely choices. topP (float) --- While generating a response, the model determines the probability of the following token at each point of generation. The value that you set for Top P determines the number of most-likely candidates from which the model chooses the next token in the sequence. For example, if you set topP to 0.8, the model only selects the next token from the top 80% of the probability distribution of next tokens. parserMode (string) --- Specifies whether to override the default parser Lambda function when parsing the raw foundation model output in the part of the agent sequence defined by the promptType. If you set the field as OVERRIDDEN, the overrideLambda field in the PromptOverrideConfiguration must be specified with the ARN of a Lambda function. promptCreationMode (string) --- Specifies whether to override the default prompt template for this promptType. Set this value to OVERRIDDEN to use the prompt that you provide in the basePromptTemplate. If you leave it as DEFAULT, the agent uses a default prompt template. promptState (string) --- Specifies whether to allow the inline agent to carry out the step specified in the promptType. If you set this value to DISABLED, the agent skips that step. The default state for each promptType is as follows. PRE_PROCESSING --- ENABLED ORCHESTRATION --- ENABLED KNOWLEDGE_BASE_RESPONSE_GENERATION --- ENABLED POST_PROCESSING --- DISABLED promptType (string) --- The step in the agent sequence that this prompt configuration applies to.",

The following example would return data sources whose animal attribute is neither cat nor dog. \"notIn\": { \"key\": \"animal\", \"value\": [\"cat\", \"dog\"] } The name that the metadata attribute must match. orAll (list) --- Knowledge base data sources are returned if their metadata attributes fulfill at least one of the filter conditions inside this list. This data type is used in the following API operations: Retrieve request --- in the filter field RetrieveAndGenerate request --- in the filter field startsWith (dict) --- Knowledge base data sources are returned if they contain a metadata attribute whose name matches the key and whose value starts with the value in this object. This filter is currently only supported for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless vector stores. The following example would return data sources with an animal attribute starts with ca (for example, cat or camel). \"startsWith\": { \"key\": \"animal\", \"value\": \"ca\" } The name that the metadata attribute must match. stringContains (dict) --- Knowledge base data sources are returned if they contain a metadata attribute whose name matches the key and whose value is one of the following: A string that contains the value as a substring. The following example would return data sources with an animal attribute that contains the substring at (for example cat). \"stringContains\": { \"key\": \"animal\", \"value\": \"at\" } A list with a member that contains the value as a substring. The following example would return data sources with an animals attribute that is a list containing a member that contains the substring at (for example [\"dog\", \"cat\"]). \"stringContains\": { \"key\": \"animals\", \"value\": \"at\" } The name that the metadata attribute must match. implicitFilterConfiguration (dict) --- Settings for implicit filtering. Metadata that can be used in a filter. (dict) --- Details about a metadata attribute. The attribute's description. The attribute's key. The attribute's type. The model that generates the filter. numberOfResults (integer) --- The number of source chunks to retrieve. overrideSearchType (string) --- By default, Amazon Bedrock decides a search strategy for you. If you're using an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless vector store that contains a filterable text field, you can specify whether to query the knowledge base with a HYBRID search using both vector embeddings and raw text, or SEMANTIC search using only vector embeddings. For other vector store configurations, only SEMANTIC search is available. For more information, see Test a knowledge base. rerankingConfiguration (dict) --- Contains configurations for reranking the retrieved results. For more information, see Improve the relevance of query responses with a reranker model. bedrockRerankingConfiguration (dict) --- Contains configurations for an Amazon Bedrock reranker model. metadataConfiguration (dict) --- Contains configurations for the metadata to use in reranking. Specifies whether to consider all metadata when reranking, or only the metadata that you select. If you specify SELECTIVE, include the selectiveModeConfiguration field. selectiveModeConfiguration (dict) --- Contains configurations for the metadata fields to include or exclude when considering reranking. fieldsToExclude (list) --- An array of objects, each of which specifies a metadata field to exclude from consideration when reranking. (dict) --- Contains information for a metadata field to include in or exclude from consideration when reranking. The name of a metadata field to include in or exclude from consideration when reranking. fieldsToInclude (list) --- An array of objects, each of which specifies a metadata field to include in consideration when reranking. The remaining metadata fields are ignored. Contains configurations for the reranker model. additionalModelRequestFields (dict) --- A JSON object whose keys are request fields for the model and whose values are values for those fields. (string) --- (document) --- The ARN of the reranker model to use. numberOfRerankedResults (integer) --- The number of results to return after reranking. The type of reranker model.",

For more information, see Inference request parameters and response fields for foundation models in the Amazon Bedrock user guide. basePromptTemplate (string) --- Defines the prompt template with which to replace the default prompt template. You can use placeholder variables in the base prompt template to customize the prompt. For more information, see Prompt template placeholder variables. For more information, see Configure the prompt templates. foundationModel (string) --- The foundation model to use. inferenceConfiguration (dict) --- Contains inference parameters to use when the agent invokes a foundation model in the part of the agent sequence defined by the promptType. For more information, see Inference parameters for foundation models. maximumLength (integer) --- The maximum number of tokens allowed in the generated response. stopSequences (list) --- A list of stop sequences. A stop sequence is a sequence of characters that causes the model to stop generating the response. (string) --- temperature (float) --- The likelihood of the model selecting higher-probability options while generating a response. A lower value makes the model more likely to choose higher-probability options, while a higher value makes the model more likely to choose lower-probability options. topK (integer) --- While generating a response, the model determines the probability of the following token at each point of generation. The value that you set for topK is the number of most-likely candidates from which the model chooses the next token in the sequence. For example, if you set topK to 50, the model selects the next token from among the top 50 most likely choices. topP (float) --- While generating a response, the model determines the probability of the following token at each point of generation. The value that you set for Top P determines the number of most-likely candidates from which the model chooses the next token in the sequence. For example, if you set topP to 0.8, the model only selects the next token from the top 80% of the probability distribution of next tokens. parserMode (string) --- Specifies whether to override the default parser Lambda function when parsing the raw foundation model output in the part of the agent sequence defined by the promptType. If you set the field as OVERRIDDEN, the overrideLambda field in the PromptOverrideConfiguration must be specified with the ARN of a Lambda function. promptCreationMode (string) --- Specifies whether to override the default prompt template for this promptType. Set this value to OVERRIDDEN to use the prompt that you provide in the basePromptTemplate. If you leave it as DEFAULT, the agent uses a default prompt template. promptState (string) --- Specifies whether to allow the inline agent to carry out the step specified in the promptType. If you set this value to DISABLED, the agent skips that step. The default state for each promptType is as follows. PRE_PROCESSING --- ENABLED ORCHESTRATION --- ENABLED KNOWLEDGE_BASE_RESPONSE_GENERATION --- ENABLED POST_PROCESSING --- DISABLED promptType (string) --- The step in the agent sequence that this prompt configuration applies to.",
