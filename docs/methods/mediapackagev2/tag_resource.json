You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. You can use the TagResource operation with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.",
