  "description": "Create a channel to start receiving content streams. The channel represents the input to MediaPackage for incoming live content from an encoder such as AWS Elemental MediaLive. The channel receives content, and after packaging it, outputs it through an origin endpoint to downstream devices (such as video players or CDNs) that request the content. You can create only one channel with each request. We recommend that you spread out channels between channel groups, such as putting redundant channels in the same AWS Region in different channel groups.",
