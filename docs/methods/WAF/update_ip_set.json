  "description": "Inserts or deletes  IPSetDescriptor objects in an IPSet. For each IPSetDescriptor object, you specify the following values: AWS WAF supports IPv4 address ranges: /8 and any range between /16 through /32. AWS WAF supports IPv6 address ranges: /24, /32, /48, /56, /64, and /128. For more information about CIDR notation, see the Wikipedia entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing. IPv6 addresses can be represented using any of the following formats: You use an IPSet to specify which web requests you want to allow or block based on the IP addresses that the requests originated from. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from one or a small number of IP addresses and you want to block the requests, you can create an IPSet that specifies those IP addresses, and then configure AWS WAF to block the requests. To create and configure an IPSet, perform the following steps: When you update an IPSet, you specify the IP addresses that you want to add and/or the IP addresses that you want to delete. If you want to change an IP address, you delete the existing IP address and add the new one. You can insert a maximum of 1000 addresses in a single request. For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.",

(dict) --- Specifies the type of update to perform to an  IPSet with  UpdateIPSet. Specifies whether to insert or delete an IP address with  UpdateIPSet. The IP address type ( IPV4 or IPV6) and the IP address range (in CIDR notation) that web requests originate from. Specify IPV4 or IPV6. Specify an IPv4 address by using CIDR notation. For example: To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify 192.0.2.44/32. To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify 192.0.2.0/24. For more information about CIDR notation, see the Wikipedia entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing. Specify an IPv6 address by using CIDR notation. For example: To configure AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128.
