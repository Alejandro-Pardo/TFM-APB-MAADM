  "description": "Transcribes the audio from a customer service call and applies any additional Request Parameters you choose to include in your request. In addition to many standard transcription features, Call Analytics provides you with call characteristics, call summarization, speaker sentiment, and optional redaction of your text transcript and your audio file. You can also apply custom categories to flag specified conditions. To learn more about these features and insights, refer to Analyzing call center audio with Call Analytics. If you want to apply categories to your Call Analytics job, you must create them before submitting your job request. Categories cannot be retroactively applied to a job. To create a new category, use the operation. To learn more about Call Analytics categories, see Creating categories for post-call transcriptions and Creating categories for real-time transcriptions. To make a StartCallAnalyticsJob request, you must first upload your media file into an Amazon S3 bucket; you can then specify the Amazon S3 location of the file using the Media parameter. Job queuing is available for Call Analytics jobs. If you pass a DataAccessRoleArn in your request and you exceed your Concurrent Job Limit, your job will automatically be added to a queue to be processed once your concurrent job count is below the limit. You must include the following parameters in your StartCallAnalyticsJob request:",

Note that if you include VocabularyFilterName in your request, you must also include VocabularyFilterMethod. VocabularyFilterMethod (string) --- Specify how you want your custom vocabulary filter applied to your transcript. To replace words with ***, choose mask. To delete words, choose remove. To flag words without changing them, choose tag. LanguageModelName (string) --- The name of the custom language model you want to use when processing your Call Analytics job. Note that custom language model names are case sensitive. The language of the specified custom language model must match the language code that you specify in your transcription request. If the languages do not match, the custom language model isn't applied. There are no errors or warnings associated with a language mismatch. ContentRedaction (dict) --- Makes it possible to redact or flag specified personally identifiable information (PII) in your transcript.

If you do not include PiiEntityTypes in your request, all PII is redacted. Specify if you want only a redacted transcript, or if you want a redacted and an unredacted transcript. When you choose redacted Amazon Transcribe creates only a redacted transcript. When you choose redacted_and_unredacted Amazon Transcribe creates a redacted and an unredacted transcript (as two separate files). PiiEntityTypes (list) --- Specify which types of personally identifiable information (PII) you want to redact in your transcript. You can include as many types as you'd like, or you can select ALL.

(string) --- LanguageIdSettings (dict) --- If using automatic language identification in your request and you want to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter, include LanguageIdSettings with the relevant sub-parameters ( VocabularyName, LanguageModelName, and VocabularyFilterName). LanguageIdSettings supports two to five language codes. Each language code you include can have an associated custom language model, custom vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The language codes that you specify must match the languages of the associated custom language models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters. It's recommended that you include LanguageOptions when using LanguageIdSettings to ensure that the correct language dialect is identified. For example, if you specify a custom vocabulary that is in en-US but Amazon Transcribe determines that the language spoken in your media is en-AU, your custom vocabulary is not applied to your transcription. If you include LanguageOptions and include en-US as the only English language dialect, your custom vocabulary is applied to your transcription. If you want to include a custom language model, custom vocabulary, or custom vocabulary filter with your request but do not want to use automatic language identification, use instead the  parameter with the LanguageModelName, VocabularyName, or VocabularyFilterName sub-parameters.
