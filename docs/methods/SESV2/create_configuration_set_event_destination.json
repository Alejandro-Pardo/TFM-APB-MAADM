When the event destination is disabled, events aren't sent to the specified destinations. MatchingEventTypes (list) --- An array that specifies which events the Amazon SES API v2 should send to the destinations in this EventDestinationDefinition. (string) --- An email sending event type. For example, email sends, opens, and bounces are all email events. KinesisFirehoseDestination (dict) --- An object that defines an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose destination for email events. You can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream data to other services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that the Amazon SES API v2 uses to send email events to the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose stream. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose stream that the Amazon SES API v2 sends email events to.

An array of objects that define the dimensions to use when you send email events to Amazon CloudWatch. (dict) --- An object that defines the dimension configuration to use when you send email events to Amazon CloudWatch. The name of an Amazon CloudWatch dimension associated with an email sending metric.

The location where the Amazon SES API v2 finds the value of a dimension to publish to Amazon CloudWatch. To use the message tags that you specify using an X-SES-MESSAGE-TAGS header or a parameter to the SendEmail or SendRawEmail API, choose messageTag. To use your own email headers, choose emailHeader. To use link tags, choose linkTags. The default value of the dimension that is published to Amazon CloudWatch if you don't provide the value of the dimension when you send an email. This value has to meet the following criteria: Can only contain ASCII letters (a---z, A---Z), numbers (0---9), underscores (_), or dashes (-), at signs (@), and periods (.). SnsDestination (dict) --- An object that defines an Amazon SNS destination for email events. You can use Amazon SNS to send notifications when certain email events occur. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to publish email events to. For more information about Amazon SNS topics, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide. EventBridgeDestination (dict) --- An object that defines an Amazon EventBridge destination for email events. You can use Amazon EventBridge to send notifications when certain email events occur. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EventBridge bus to publish email events to. Only the default bus is supported. PinpointDestination (dict) --- An object that defines an Amazon Pinpoint project destination for email events.
