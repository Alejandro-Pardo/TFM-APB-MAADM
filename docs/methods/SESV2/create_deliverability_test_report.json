  "description": "Create a new predictive inbox placement test. Predictive inbox placement tests can help you predict how your messages will be handled by various email providers around the world. When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers. Amazon SES then sends that message to special email addresses spread across several major email providers. After about 24 hours, the test is complete, and you can use the GetDeliverabilityTestReport operation to view the results of the test.",

      "description": "The HTML body of the message that you sent when you performed the predictive inbox placement test. Simple (dict) --- The simple email message. The message consists of a subject, message body and attachments list. The subject line of the email. The subject line can only contain 7-bit ASCII characters. However, you can specify non-ASCII characters in the subject line by using encoded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047. The content of the message itself. Charset (string) --- The character set for the content. Because of the constraints of the SMTP protocol, Amazon SES uses 7-bit ASCII by default. If the text includes characters outside of the ASCII range, you have to specify a character set. For example, you could specify UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, or Shift_JIS. The body of the message. You can specify an HTML version of the message, a text-only version of the message, or both. Text (dict) --- An object that represents the version of the message that is displayed in email clients that don't support HTML, or clients where the recipient has disabled HTML rendering. Html (dict) --- An object that represents the version of the message that is displayed in email clients that support HTML. HTML messages can include formatted text, hyperlinks, images, and more. Headers (list) --- The list of message headers that will be added to the email message. (dict) --- Contains the name and value of a message header that you add to an email. The name of the message header. The message header name has to meet the following criteria: Can contain any printable ASCII character (33 - 126) except for colon (:). Can contain no more than 126 characters. The value of the message header. The message header value has to meet the following criteria: Can contain any printable ASCII character. Can contain no more than 870 characters. Attachments (list) --- The List of attachments to include in your email. All recipients will receive the same attachments. (dict) --- Contains metadata and attachment raw content. The raw data of the attachment. It needs to be base64-encoded if you are accessing Amazon SES directly through the HTTPS interface. If you are accessing Amazon SES using an Amazon Web Services SDK, the SDK takes care of the base 64-encoding for you. ContentDisposition (string) --- A standard descriptor indicating how the attachment should be rendered in the email. Supported values: ATTACHMENT or INLINE. The file name for the attachment as it will appear in the email. Amazon SES restricts certain file extensions. To ensure attachments are accepted, check the Unsupported attachment types in the Amazon SES Developer Guide. ContentDescription (string) --- A brief description of the attachment content. ContentId (string) --- Unique identifier for the attachment, used for referencing attachments with INLINE disposition in HTML content. ContentTransferEncoding (string) --- Specifies how the attachment is encoded. Supported values: BASE64, QUOTED_PRINTABLE, SEVEN_BIT. ContentType (string) --- The MIME type of the attachment. Raw (dict) --- The raw email message. The message has to meet the following criteria: The message has to contain a header and a body, separated by one blank line. All of the required header fields must be present in the message. Each part of a multipart MIME message must be formatted properly. If you include attachments, they must be in a file format that the Amazon SES API v2 supports. The raw data of the message needs to base64-encoded if you are accessing Amazon SES directly through the HTTPS interface. If any of the MIME parts in your message contain content that is outside of the 7-bit ASCII character range, you should encode that content to ensure that recipients' email clients render the message properly. The length of any single line of text in the message can't exceed 1,000 characters. This restriction is defined in RFC 5321. The raw email message. Attachments must be in a file format that the Amazon SES supports. Template (dict) --- The template to use for the email message. TemplateName (string) --- The name of the template. You will refer to this name when you send email using the SendEmail or SendBulkEmail operations. TemplateArn (string) --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the template. TemplateContent (dict) --- The content of the template. Subject (string) --- The subject line of the email. Text (string) --- The email body that will be visible to recipients whose email clients do not display HTML. Html (string) --- The HTML body of the email. TemplateData (string) --- An object that defines the values to use for message variables in the template. This object is a set of key-value pairs. Each key defines a message variable in the template. The corresponding value defines the value to use for that variable. ContentType (string) --- The MIME type of the attachment.",

Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags. Each tag consists of a required\u00c2\u00a0tag key\u00c2\u00a0and an associated\u00c2\u00a0tag value, both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags: Tag keys and values are case sensitive. For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value. The\u00c2\u00a0 aws:\u00c2\u00a0prefix is reserved for use by Amazon Web Services; you can't use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don't count against the limit of 50 tags per resource. You can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your Amazon Web Services account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified Amazon Web Services Region for your Amazon Web Services account.
