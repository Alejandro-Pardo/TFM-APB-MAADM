This operation supports resource-level authorization using an IAM policy and the Names parameter. If you specify the Names parameter, the operation is successful only if you have authorization to view all the canaries that you specify in your request. If you do not have permission to view any of the canaries, the request fails with a 403 response. You are required to use the Names parameter if you are logged on to a user or role that has an IAM policy that restricts which canaries that you are allowed to view.
