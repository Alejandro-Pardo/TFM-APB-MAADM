The only resources that can be tagged are rule groups namespaces, scrapers, and workspaces. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. To remove a tag, use UntagResource.",
