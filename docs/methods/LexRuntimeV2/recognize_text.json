The next action that the bot should take in its interaction with the user. The following values are possible: Close --- Indicates that there will not be a response from the user. For example, the statement 'Your order has been placed' does not require a response. ConfirmIntent --- The next action is asking the user if the intent is complete and ready to be fulfilled. This is a yes/no question such as 'Place the order?' Delegate --- The next action is determined by Amazon Lex V2. ElicitIntent --- The next action is to elicit an intent from the user. ElicitSlot --- The next action is to elicit a slot value from the user. slotToElicit (string) --- The name of the slot that should be elicited from the user. slotElicitationStyle (string) --- Configures the slot to use spell-by-letter or spell-by-word style. When you use a style on a slot, users can spell out their input to make it clear to your bot. Spell by letter - 'b' 'o' 'b' Spell by word - 'b as in boy' 'o as in oscar' 'b as in boy' For more information, see Using spelling to enter slot values. subSlotToElicit (dict) --- The name of the constituent sub slot of the composite slot specified in slotToElicit that should be elicited from the user. The name of the slot that should be elicited from the user. subSlotToElicit (dict) --- The field is not supported. intent (dict) --- The active intent that Amazon Lex V2 is processing.

The value that Amazon Lex V2 determines for the slot, given the user input. The actual value depends on the setting of the value selection strategy for the bot. You can choose to use the value entered by the user, or you can have Amazon Lex V2 choose the first value in the resolvedValues list. resolvedValues (list) --- A list of values that Amazon Lex V2 determines are possible resolutions for the user input. The first value matches the interpretedValue. (string) --- shape (string) --- When the shape value is List, it indicates that the values field contains a list of slot values. When the value is Scalar, it indicates that the value field contains a single value. values (list) --- A list of one or more values that the user provided for the slot. For example, if a for a slot that elicits pizza toppings, the values might be 'pepperoni' and 'pineapple.' (dict) --- A value that Amazon Lex V2 uses to fulfill an intent. subSlots (dict) --- The constituent sub slots of a composite slot. state (string) --- Indicates the fulfillment state for the intent. The meanings of each value are as follows: Failed --- The bot failed to fulfill the intent. Fulfilled --- The bot has completed fulfillment of the intent. FulfillmentInProgress --- The bot is in the middle of fulfilling the intent. InProgress --- The bot is in the middle of eliciting the slot values that are necessary to fulfill the intent. ReadyForFulfillment --- The bot has elicited all the slot values for the intent and is ready to fulfill the intent. Waiting --- The bot is waiting for a response from the user (limited to streaming conversations). confirmationState (string) --- Indicates whether the intent has been Confirmed, Denied, or None if the confirmation stage has not yet been reached. activeContexts (list) --- One or more contexts that indicate to Amazon Lex V2 the context of a request. When a context is active, Amazon Lex V2 considers intents with the matching context as a trigger as the next intent in a session. (dict) --- Contains information about the contexts that a user is using in a session. You can configure Amazon Lex V2 to set a context when an intent is fulfilled, or you can set a context using the , , or operations. Use a context to indicate to Amazon Lex V2 intents that should be used as follow-up intents. For example, if the active context is order-fulfilled, only intents that have order-fulfilled configured as a trigger are considered for follow up. The name of the context. Indicates the number of turns or seconds that the context is active. Once the time to live expires, the context is no longer returned in a response. The number of seconds that the context is active. You can specify between 5 and 86400 seconds (24 hours). The number of turns that the context is active. You can specify up to 20 turns. Each request and response from the bot is a turn. A list of contexts active for the request. A context can be activated when a previous intent is fulfilled, or by including the context in the request. If you don't specify a list of contexts, Amazon Lex V2 will use the current list of contexts for the session. If you specify an empty list, all contexts for the session are cleared.

It contains application information passed between Amazon Lex V2 and a client application. (string) --- (string) --- originatingRequestId (string) --- A unique identifier for a specific request. runtimeHints (dict) --- Hints for phrases that a customer is likely to use for a slot. Amazon Lex V2 uses the hints to help determine the correct value of a slot. slotHints (dict) --- A list of the slots in the intent that should have runtime hints added, and the phrases that should be added for each slot. The first level of the slotHints map is the name of the intent. The second level is the name of the slot within the intent. For more information, see Using hints to improve accuracy. The intent name and slot name must exist. (string) --- (dict) --- (string) --- (dict) --- Provides an array of phrases that should be given preference when resolving values for a slot. runtimeHintValues (list) --- One or more strings that Amazon Lex V2 should look for in the input to the bot. Each phrase is given preference when deciding on slot values. (dict) --- Provides the phrase that Amazon Lex V2 should look for in the user's input to the bot. The phrase that Amazon Lex V2 should look for in the user's input to the bot. subSlotHints (dict) --- A map of constituent sub slot names inside a composite slot in the intent and the phrases that should be added for each sub slot. Inside each composite slot hints, this structure provides a mechanism to add granular sub slot phrases. Only sub slot hints are supported for composite slots.
