The name of the webhook. The name of the pipeline you want to connect to the webhook. The name of the action in a pipeline you want to connect to the webhook. The action must be from the source (first) stage of the pipeline. A list of rules applied to the body/payload sent in the POST request to a webhook URL. All defined rules must pass for the request to be accepted and the pipeline started. (dict) --- The event criteria that specify when a webhook notification is sent to your URL. A JsonPath expression that is applied to the body/payload of the webhook. The value selected by the JsonPath expression must match the value specified in the MatchEquals field. Otherwise, the request is ignored. For more information, see Java JsonPath implementation in GitHub. matchEquals (string) --- The value selected by the JsonPath expression must match what is supplied in the MatchEquals field. Properties from the target action configuration can be included as placeholders in this value by surrounding the action configuration key with curly brackets. For example, if the value supplied here is 'refs/heads/{Branch}' and the target action has an action configuration property called 'Branch' with a value of 'main', the MatchEquals value is evaluated as 'refs/heads/main'. For a list of action configuration properties for built-in action types, see Pipeline Structure Reference Action Requirements. Supported options are GITHUB_HMAC, IP, and UNAUTHENTICATED. For information about the authentication scheme implemented by GITHUB_HMAC, see Securing your webhooks on the GitHub Developer website. IP rejects webhooks trigger requests unless they originate from an IP address in the IP range whitelisted in the authentication configuration. UNAUTHENTICATED accepts all webhook trigger requests regardless of origin. Properties that configure the authentication applied to incoming webhook trigger requests. The required properties depend on the authentication type. For GITHUB_HMAC, only the ``SecretToken ``property must be set. For IP, only the ``AllowedIPRange ``property must be set to a valid CIDR range. For UNAUTHENTICATED, no properties can be set.
