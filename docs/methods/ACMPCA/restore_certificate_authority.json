  "description": "Restores a certificate authority (CA) that is in the DELETED state. You can restore a CA during the period that you defined in the PermanentDeletionTimeInDays parameter of the DeleteCertificateAuthority action. Currently, you can specify 7 to 30 days. If you did not specify a PermanentDeletionTimeInDays value, by default you can restore the CA at any time in a 30 day period. You can check the time remaining in the restoration period of a private CA in the DELETED state by calling the DescribeCertificateAuthority or ListCertificateAuthorities actions. The status of a restored CA is set to its pre-deletion status when the RestoreCertificateAuthority action returns. To change its status to ACTIVE, call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action. If the private CA was in the PENDING_CERTIFICATE state at deletion, you must use the ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate action to import a certificate authority into the private CA before it can be activated. You cannot restore a CA after the restoration period has ended.",
