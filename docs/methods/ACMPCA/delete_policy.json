If there is no policy attached to the private CA, this action will return successful. If you delete a policy that was applied through Amazon Web Services Resource Access Manager (RAM), the CA will be removed from all shares in which it was included. The Certificate Manager Service Linked Role that the policy supports is not affected when you delete the policy. The current policy can be shown with GetPolicy and updated with PutPolicy.",
