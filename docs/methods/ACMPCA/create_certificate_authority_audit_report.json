  "description": "Creates an audit report that lists every time that your CA private key is used to issue a certificate. The IssueCertificate and RevokeCertificate actions use the private key. To save the audit report to your designated Amazon S3 bucket, you must create a bucket policy that grants Amazon Web Services Private CA permission to access and write to it. For an example policy, see Prepare an Amazon S3 bucket for audit reports. Amazon Web Services Private CA assets that are stored in Amazon S3 can be protected with encryption. For more information, see Encrypting Your Audit Reports.",
