  "description": "Sends user input (text or speech) to Amazon Lex. Clients use this API to send text and audio requests to Amazon Lex at runtime. Amazon Lex interprets the user input using the machine learning model that it built for the bot. The PostContent operation supports audio input at 8kHz and 16kHz. You can use 8kHz audio to achieve higher speech recognition accuracy in telephone audio applications. In response, Amazon Lex returns the next message to convey to the user. Consider the following example messages: Not all Amazon Lex messages require a response from the user. For example, conclusion statements do not require a response. Some messages require only a yes or no response. In addition to the message, Amazon Lex provides additional context about the message in the response that you can use to enhance client behavior, such as displaying the appropriate client user interface. Consider the following examples: In addition, Amazon Lex also returns your application-specific sessionAttributes. For more information, see Managing Conversation Context.",

If you want a user to start a conversation on one device and continue on another device, use a user-specific identifier. If you want the same user to be able to have two independent conversations on two different devices, choose a device-specific identifier. A user can't have two independent conversations with two different versions of the same bot. For example, a user can't have a conversation with the PROD and BETA versions of the same bot.
