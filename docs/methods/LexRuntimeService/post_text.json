Amazon Lex then interprets the user input using the machine learning model it built for the bot. In response, Amazon Lex returns the next message to convey to the user an optional responseCard to display. Consider the following example messages: Not all Amazon Lex messages require a user response. For example, a conclusion statement does not require a response. Some messages require only a 'yes' or 'no' user response. In addition to the message, Amazon Lex provides additional context about the message in the response that you might use to enhance client behavior, for example, to display the appropriate client user interface. These are the slotToElicit, dialogState, intentName, and slots fields in the response. Consider the following examples: In addition, Amazon Lex also returns your application-specific sessionAttributes. For more information, see Managing Conversation Context.",
