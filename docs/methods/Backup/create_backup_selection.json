The ARN of the IAM role that Backup uses to authenticate when backing up the target resource; for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access. Resources (list) --- The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources to assign to a backup plan. The maximum number of ARNs is 500 without wildcards, or 30 ARNs with wildcards. If you need to assign many resources to a backup plan, consider a different resource selection strategy, such as assigning all resources of a resource type or refining your resource selection using tags. If you specify multiple ARNs, the resources much match any of the ARNs (OR logic). (string) --- ListOfTags (list) --- The conditions that you define to assign resources to your backup plans using tags. For example, \"StringEquals\": { \"ConditionKey\": \"backup\", \"ConditionValue\": \"daily\"}. ListOfTags supports only StringEquals. Condition operators are case sensitive. If you specify multiple conditions, the resources much match any of the conditions (OR logic). (dict) --- Contains an array of triplets made up of a condition type (such as StringEquals), a key, and a value. Used to filter resources using their tags and assign them to a backup plan. Case sensitive. An operation applied to a key-value pair used to assign resources to your backup plan. Condition only supports StringEquals. For more flexible assignment options, including StringLike and the ability to exclude resources from your backup plan, use Conditions (with an 's' on the end) for your BackupSelection. The key in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag Department: Accounting, Department is the key. The value in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag Department: Accounting, Accounting is the value. NotResources (list) --- The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources to exclude from a backup plan. If you need to exclude many resources from a backup plan, consider a different resource selection strategy, such as assigning only one or a few resource types or refining your resource selection using tags. (string) --- Conditions (dict) --- The conditions that you define to assign resources to your backup plans using tags. For example, \"StringEquals\": { \"ConditionKey\": \"aws:ResourceTag/backup\", \"ConditionValue\": \"daily\" }. Conditions supports StringEquals, StringLike, StringNotEquals, and StringNotLike. If you specify multiple conditions, the resources much match all conditions (AND logic). StringEquals (list) --- Filters the values of your tagged resources for only those resources that you tagged with the same value. Also called 'exact matching.' (dict) --- Includes information about tags you define to assign tagged resources to a backup plan. Include the prefix aws:ResourceTag in your tags. For example, \"aws:ResourceTag/TagKey1\": \"Value1\". ConditionKey (string) --- The key in a key-value pair. ConditionValue (string) --- The value in a key-value pair. StringNotEquals (list) --- Filters the values of your tagged resources for only those resources that you tagged that do not have the same value. Also called 'negated matching.' (dict) --- Includes information about tags you define to assign tagged resources to a backup plan. StringLike (list) --- Filters the values of your tagged resources for matching tag values with the use of a wildcard character (*) anywhere in the string. For example, 'prod*' or 'rod' matches the tag value 'production'. (dict) --- Includes information about tags you define to assign tagged resources to a backup plan. StringNotLike (list) --- Filters the values of your tagged resources for non-matching tag values with the use of a wildcard character (*) anywhere in the string.
