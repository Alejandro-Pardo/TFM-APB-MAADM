  "description": "Deletes the recovery point specified by a recovery point ID. If the recovery point ID belongs to a continuous backup, calling this endpoint deletes the existing continuous backup and stops future continuous backup. When an IAM role's permissions are insufficient to call this API, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body, but the recovery point is not deleted. Instead, it enters an EXPIRED state. EXPIRED recovery points can be deleted with this API once the IAM role has the iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole action. To learn more about adding this role, see Troubleshooting manual deletions. If the user or role is deleted or the permission within the role is removed, the deletion will not be successful and will enter an EXPIRED state.",
