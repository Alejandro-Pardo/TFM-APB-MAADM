  "description": "This request can be sent after CreateRestoreTestingPlan request returns successfully. This is the second part of creating a resource testing plan, and it must be completed sequentially. This consists of RestoreTestingSelectionName, ProtectedResourceType, and one of the following: Each protected resource type can have one single value. A restore testing selection can include a wildcard value ('*') for ProtectedResourceArns along with ProtectedResourceConditions. Alternatively, you can include up to 30 specific protected resource ARNs in ProtectedResourceArns. Cannot select by both protected resource types AND specific ARNs. Request will fail if both are included.",
