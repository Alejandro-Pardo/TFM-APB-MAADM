  "description": "Creates a configuration for an application to use grants. Conceptually grants are authorization to request actions related to tokens. This configuration will be used when parties are requesting and receiving tokens during the trusted identity propagation process. For more information on the IAM Identity Center supported grant workflows, see SAML 2.0 and OAuth 2.0. A grant is created between your applications and Identity Center instance which enables an application to use specified mechanisms to obtain tokens. These tokens are used by your applications to gain access to Amazon Web Services resources on behalf of users. The following elements are within these exchanges: User credentials are never shared directly within these exchanges. Instead, applications use grants to request access tokens from IAM Identity Center. For more information, see RFC 6479.",
