You can also model commitment addition and commitment removal. After all changes in a Bill scenario is made satisfactorily, you can call this API with a Bill scenario ID to generate the Bill estimate. Bill estimate calculates the pre-tax cost for your consolidated billing family, incorporating all modeled usage and commitments alongside existing usage and commitments from your most recent completed anniversary bill, with any applicable discounts applied.",
