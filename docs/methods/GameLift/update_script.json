To update script content, provide an updated zip file by pointing to either a local file or an Amazon S3 bucket location. You can use either method regardless of how the original script was uploaded. Use the Version parameter to track updates to the script. If the call is successful, the updated metadata is stored in the script record and a revised script is uploaded to the Amazon GameLift service. Once the script is updated and acquired by a fleet instance, the new version is used for all new game sessions. Amazon GameLift Amazon GameLift Realtime. All APIs by task.",
