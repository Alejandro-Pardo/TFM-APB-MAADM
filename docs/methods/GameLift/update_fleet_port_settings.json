List the permissions you want to add in InboundPermissionAuthorizations, and permissions you want to remove in InboundPermissionRevocations. Permissions to be removed must match existing fleet permissions. If successful, the fleet ID for the updated fleet is returned. For fleets with remote locations, port setting updates can take time to propagate across all locations. You can check the status of updates in each location by calling DescribeFleetPortSettings with a location name. Setting up Amazon GameLift fleets.",
