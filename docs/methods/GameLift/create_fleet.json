  "description": "Creates a fleet of compute resources to host your game servers. Use this operation to set up the following types of fleets based on compute type: An EC2 fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Your game server build is deployed to each fleet instance. Amazon GameLift manages the fleet's instances and controls the lifecycle of game server processes, which host game sessions for players. EC2 fleets can have instances in multiple locations. Each instance in the fleet is designated a Compute. To create an EC2 fleet, provide these required parameters: If successful, this operation creates a new fleet resource and places it in NEW status while Amazon GameLift initiates the fleet creation workflow. To debug your fleet, fetch logs, view performance metrics or other actions on the fleet, create a development fleet with port 22/3389 open. As a best practice, we recommend opening ports for remote access only when you need them and closing them when you're finished. When the fleet status is ACTIVE, you can adjust capacity settings and turn autoscaling on/off for each location. An Anywhere fleet represents compute resources that are not owned or managed by Amazon GameLift. You might create an Anywhere fleet with your local machine for testing, or use one to host game servers with on-premises hardware or other game hosting solutions. To create an Anywhere fleet, provide these required parameters: If successful, this operation creates a new fleet resource and places it in ACTIVE status. You can register computes with a fleet in ACTIVE status. Setting up fleets. Debug fleet creation issues. Multi-location fleets.",
