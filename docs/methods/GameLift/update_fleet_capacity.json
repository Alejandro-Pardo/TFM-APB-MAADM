  "description": "Updates capacity settings for a managed EC2 fleet or managed container fleet. For these fleets, you adjust capacity by changing the number of instances in the fleet. Fleet capacity determines the number of game sessions and players that the fleet can host based on its configuration. For fleets with multiple locations, use this operation to manage capacity settings in each location individually. Use this operation to set these fleet capacity properties: To update capacity for a fleet's home Region, or if the fleet has no remote locations, omit the Location parameter. The fleet must be in ACTIVE status. To update capacity for a fleet's remote location, set the Location parameter to the location to update. The location must be in ACTIVE status. If successful, Amazon GameLift updates the capacity settings and returns the identifiers for the updated fleet and/or location. If a requested change to desired capacity exceeds the instance type's limit, the LimitExceeded exception occurs. Updates often prompt an immediate change in fleet capacity, such as when current capacity is different than the new desired capacity or outside the new limits. In this scenario, Amazon GameLift automatically initiates steps to add or remove instances in the fleet location. You can track a fleet's current capacity by calling DescribeFleetCapacity or DescribeFleetLocationCapacity. Scaling fleet capacity.",
