  "description": "Finds new players to fill open slots in currently running game sessions. The backfill match process is essentially identical to the process of forming new matches. Backfill requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements. When using FlexMatch with Amazon GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling this operation with a GameSessions ID. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the GameSession resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier request. When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game session that is being backfilled. To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being backfilled. Optionally, specify the GameSession ARN. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches. Only game sessions created by FlexMatch are supported for match backfill. Backfill existing games with FlexMatch. Matchmaking events (reference) How Amazon GameLift FlexMatch works.",

PlayerID, PlayerAttributes, Team --- This information is maintained in the GameSession object, MatchmakerData property, for all players who are currently assigned to the game session. The matchmaker data is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. For more details, see Match Data. The backfill request must specify the team membership for every player. Do not specify team if you are not using backfill. LatencyInMs --- If the matchmaker uses player latency, include a latency value, in milliseconds, for the Region that the game session is currently in. Do not include latency values for any other Region. (dict) --- Represents a player in matchmaking. When starting a matchmaking request, a player has a player ID, attributes, and may have latency data. Team information is added after a match has been successfully completed. PlayerId (string) --- A unique identifier for a player PlayerAttributes (dict) --- A collection of key:value pairs containing player information for use in matchmaking. Player attribute keys must match the playerAttributes used in a matchmaking rule set. Example: \"PlayerAttributes\": {\"skill\": {\"N\": \"23\"}, \"gameMode\": {\"S\": \"deathmatch\"}}.

Maximum length for each string is 100 characters. Duplicate values are not recognized; all occurrences of the repeated value after the first of a repeated value are ignored.

(string) --- (float) --- Team (string) --- Name of the team that the player is assigned to in a match. Team names are defined in a matchmaking rule set. LatencyInMs (dict) --- A set of values, expressed in milliseconds, that indicates the amount of latency that a player experiences when connected to Amazon Web Services Regions. If this property is present, FlexMatch considers placing the match only in Regions for which latency is reported. If a matchmaker has a rule that evaluates player latency, players must report latency in order to be matched. If no latency is reported in this scenario, FlexMatch assumes that no Regions are available to the player and the ticket is not matchable. (string) --- (integer) ---",
