  "description": "Retrieves one or more matchmaking tickets. Use this operation to retrieve ticket information, including---after a successful match is made---connection information for the resulting new game session. To request matchmaking tickets, provide a list of up to 10 ticket IDs. If the request is successful, a ticket object is returned for each requested ID that currently exists. This operation is not designed to be continually called to track matchmaking ticket status. This practice can cause you to exceed your API limit, which results in errors. Instead, as a best practice, set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service to receive notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration. Add FlexMatch to a game client. Set Up FlexMatch event notification.",
