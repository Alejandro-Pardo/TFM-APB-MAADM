  "description": "Updates the properties of a managed container fleet. Depending on the properties being updated, this operation might initiate a fleet deployment. You can track deployments for a fleet using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetDeployment.html. As with CreateContainerFleet, many fleet properties use common defaults or are calculated based on the fleet's container group definitions. Changes to the following properties initiate a fleet deployment: If successful, this operation updates the container fleet resource, and might initiate a new deployment of fleet resources using the deployment configuration provided. A deployment replaces existing fleet instances with new instances that are deployed with the updated fleet properties. The fleet is placed in UPDATING status until the deployment is complete, then return to ACTIVE. You can have only one update deployment active at a time for a fleet. If a second update request initiates a deployment while another deployment is in progress, the first deployment is cancelled.",
