You can filter the result set to find only those fleets that are deployed with a specific build or script. For fleets that have multiple locations, this operation retrieves fleets based on their home Region only. You can use operation in the following ways: Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, this operation returns a list of fleet IDs that match the request parameters. A NextToken value is also returned if there are more result pages to retrieve.",
