Use this operation to connect to instances with game servers that use Amazon GameLift server SDK 4.x or earlier. To connect to instances with game servers that use server SDK 5.x or later, call https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GetComputeAccess. To request access to an instance, specify IDs for the instance and the fleet it belongs to. You can retrieve instance IDs for a fleet by calling DescribeInstances with the fleet ID. If successful, this operation returns an IP address and credentials. The returned credentials match the operating system of the instance, as follows: Remotely connect to fleet instances.
