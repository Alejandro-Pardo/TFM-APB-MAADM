  "description": "Retrieves all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria and sorts them into a specified order. This operation is not designed to continually track game session status because that practice can cause you to exceed your API limit and generate errors. Instead, configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive notifications from a matchmaker or a game session placement queue. When searching for game sessions, you specify exactly where you want to search and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all of a fleet's locations. This operation can be used in the following ways: Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a GameSession object is returned for each game session that matches the request. Search finds game sessions that are in ACTIVE status only. To retrieve information on game sessions in other statuses, use DescribeGameSessions. To set search and sort criteria, create a filter expression using the following game session attributes. For game session search examples, see the Examples section of this topic. All APIs by task.",

If no filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in ACTIVE status. A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions.

Valid values are gameSessionName, gameSessionId, gameSessionProperties, maximumSessions, creationTimeMillis, playerSessionCount, hasAvailablePlayerSessions. Comparator --- Valid comparators are: =, <>, <, >, <=, >=. Value --- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators = and <>. For example, the following filter expression searches on gameSessionName: ' FilterExpression\": \"gameSessionName = 'Matt\\\\'s Awesome Game 1'\". To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords AND, OR, and NOT and parentheses as needed. For example: x AND y AND NOT z, NOT (x OR y). Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules: =, <>, <, >, <=, >= Parentheses NOT AND OR For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open player slot: \"maximumSessions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true\".",
