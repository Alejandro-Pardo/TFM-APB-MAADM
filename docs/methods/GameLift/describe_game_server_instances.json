  "description": "Retrieves status information about the Amazon EC2 instances associated with a Amazon GameLift FleetIQ game server group. Use this operation to detect when instances are active or not available to host new game servers. To request status for all instances in the game server group, provide a game server group ID only. To request status for specific instances, provide the game server group ID and one or more instance IDs. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results in sequential segments. If successful, a collection of GameServerInstance objects is returned. This operation is not designed to be called with every game server claim request; this practice can cause you to exceed your API limit, which results in errors. Instead, as a best practice, cache the results and refresh your cache no more than once every 10 seconds. Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Guide.",
