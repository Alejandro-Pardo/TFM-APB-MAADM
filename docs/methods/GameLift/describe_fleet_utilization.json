  "description": "Retrieves utilization statistics for one or more fleets. Utilization data provides a snapshot of how the fleet's hosting resources are currently being used. For fleets with remote locations, this operation retrieves data for the fleet's home Region only. See DescribeFleetLocationUtilization to get utilization statistics for a fleet's remote locations. This operation can be used in the following ways: When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a FleetUtilization object is returned for each requested fleet ID, unless the fleet identifier is not found. Each fleet utilization object includes a Location property, which is set to the fleet's home Region. Setting up Amazon GameLift Fleets. GameLift Metrics for Fleets.",
