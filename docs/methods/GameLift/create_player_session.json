  "description": "Reserves an open player slot in a game session for a player. New player sessions can be created in any game session with an open slot that is in ACTIVE status and has a player creation policy of ACCEPT_ALL. You can add a group of players to a game session with CreatePlayerSessions . To create a player session, specify a game session ID, player ID, and optionally a set of player data. If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for the player and a new PlayerSessions object is returned with a player session ID. The player references the player session ID when sending a connection request to the game session, and the game server can use it to validate the player reservation with the Amazon GameLift service. Player sessions cannot be updated. The maximum number of players per game session is 200. It is not adjustable. All APIs by task.",
