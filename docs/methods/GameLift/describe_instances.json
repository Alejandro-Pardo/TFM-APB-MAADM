  "description": "Retrieves information about the EC2 instances in an Amazon GameLift managed fleet, including instance ID, connection data, and status. You can use this operation with a multi-location fleet to get location-specific instance information. As an alternative, use the operations https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_ListCompute and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeCompute to retrieve information for compute resources, including EC2 and Anywhere fleets. You can call this operation in the following ways: Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, this operation returns Instance objects for each requested instance, listed in no particular order. If you call this operation for an Anywhere fleet, you receive an InvalidRequestException. Remotely connect to fleet instances. Debug fleet issues. All APIs by task.",
