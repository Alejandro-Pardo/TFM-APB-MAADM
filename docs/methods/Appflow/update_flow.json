The type of connector, such as Salesforce, Amplitude, and so on. apiVersion (string) --- The API version of the connector when it's used as a source in the flow. connectorProfileName (string) --- The name of the connector profile. This name must be unique for each connector profile in the Amazon Web Services account. Specifies the information that is required to query a particular source connector. Amplitude (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Amplitude. The object specified in the Amplitude flow source. Datadog (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Datadog. The object specified in the Datadog flow source. Dynatrace (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Dynatrace. The object specified in the Dynatrace flow source. GoogleAnalytics (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Google Analytics. The object specified in the Google Analytics flow source. InforNexus (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Infor Nexus. The object specified in the Infor Nexus flow source. Marketo (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Marketo. The object specified in the Marketo flow source. S3 (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Amazon S3. The Amazon S3 bucket name where the source files are stored. bucketPrefix (string) --- The object key for the Amazon S3 bucket in which the source files are stored. s3InputFormatConfig (dict) --- When you use Amazon S3 as the source, the configuration format that you provide the flow input data. s3InputFileType (string) --- The file type that Amazon AppFlow gets from your Amazon S3 bucket. Salesforce (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Salesforce. The object specified in the Salesforce flow source. enableDynamicFieldUpdate (boolean) --- The flag that enables dynamic fetching of new (recently added) fields in the Salesforce objects while running a flow. includeDeletedRecords (boolean) --- Indicates whether Amazon AppFlow includes deleted files in the flow run. dataTransferApi (string) --- Specifies which Salesforce API is used by Amazon AppFlow when your flow transfers data from Salesforce. AUTOMATIC The default. Amazon AppFlow selects which API to use based on the number of records that your flow transfers from Salesforce. If your flow transfers fewer than 1,000,000 records, Amazon AppFlow uses Salesforce REST API. If your flow transfers 1,000,000 records or more, Amazon AppFlow uses Salesforce Bulk API 2.0. Each of these Salesforce APIs structures data differently. If Amazon AppFlow selects the API automatically, be aware that, for recurring flows, the data output might vary from one flow run to the next. For example, if a flow runs daily, it might use REST API on one day to transfer 900,000 records, and it might use Bulk API 2.0 on the next day to transfer 1,100,000 records. For each of these flow runs, the respective Salesforce API formats the data differently. Some of the differences include how dates are formatted and null values are represented. Also, Bulk API 2.0 doesn't transfer Salesforce compound fields. By choosing this option, you optimize flow performance for both small and large data transfers, but the tradeoff is inconsistent formatting in the output. BULKV2 Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce Bulk API 2.0. This API runs asynchronous data transfers, and it's optimal for large sets of data. By choosing this option, you ensure that your flow writes consistent output, but you optimize performance only for large data transfers. Note that Bulk API 2.0 does not transfer Salesforce compound fields. REST_SYNC Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce REST API. By choosing this option, you ensure that your flow writes consistent output, but you decrease performance for large data transfers that are better suited for Bulk API 2.0. In some cases, if your flow attempts to transfer a vary large set of data, it might fail wituh a timed out error. ServiceNow (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying ServiceNow. The object specified in the ServiceNow flow source. Singular (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Singular. The object specified in the Singular flow source. Slack (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Slack. The object specified in the Slack flow source. Trendmicro (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Trend Micro. The object specified in the Trend Micro flow source. Veeva (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Veeva. The object specified in the Veeva flow source. documentType (string) --- The document type specified in the Veeva document extract flow. includeSourceFiles (boolean) --- Boolean value to include source files in Veeva document extract flow. includeRenditions (boolean) --- Boolean value to include file renditions in Veeva document extract flow. includeAllVersions (boolean) --- Boolean value to include All Versions of files in Veeva document extract flow. Zendesk (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Zendesk. The object specified in the Zendesk flow source. SAPOData (dict) --- The properties that are applied when using SAPOData as a flow source. objectPath (string) --- The object path specified in the SAPOData flow source. parallelismConfig (dict) --- Sets the number of concurrent processes that transfers OData records from your SAP instance. The maximum number of processes that Amazon AppFlow runs at the same time when it retrieves your data from your SAP application. paginationConfig (dict) --- Sets the page size for each concurrent process that transfers OData records from your SAP instance. The maximum number of records that Amazon AppFlow receives in each page of the response from your SAP application. For transfers of OData records, the maximum page size is 3,000. For transfers of data that comes from an ODP provider, the maximum page size is 10,000. CustomConnector (dict) --- The properties that are applied when the custom connector is being used as a source. The entity specified in the custom connector as a source in the flow. customProperties (dict) --- Custom properties that are required to use the custom connector as a source. (string) --- (string) --- dataTransferApi (dict) --- The API of the connector application that Amazon AppFlow uses to transfer your data. Name (string) --- The name of the connector application API. Type (string) --- You can specify one of the following types: AUTOMATIC The default. Optimizes a flow for datasets that fluctuate in size from small to large. For each flow run, Amazon AppFlow chooses to use the SYNC or ASYNC API type based on the amount of data that the run transfers. SYNC A synchronous API. This type of API optimizes a flow for small to medium-sized datasets. ASYNC An asynchronous API. This type of API optimizes a flow for large datasets. Pardot (dict) --- Specifies the information that is required for querying Salesforce Pardot. The object specified in the Salesforce Pardot flow source. incrementalPullConfig (dict) --- Defines the configuration for a scheduled incremental data pull. If a valid configuration is provided, the fields specified in the configuration are used when querying for the incremental data pull. datetimeTypeFieldName (string) --- A field that specifies the date time or timestamp field as the criteria to use when importing incremental records from the source.",

AUTOMATIC The default. Amazon AppFlow selects which API to use based on the number of records that your flow transfers to Salesforce. If your flow transfers fewer than 1,000 records, Amazon AppFlow uses Salesforce REST API. If your flow transfers 1,000 records or more, Amazon AppFlow uses Salesforce Bulk API 2.0. Each of these Salesforce APIs structures data differently. If Amazon AppFlow selects the API automatically, be aware that, for recurring flows, the data output might vary from one flow run to the next. For example, if a flow runs daily, it might use REST API on one day to transfer 900 records, and it might use Bulk API 2.0 on the next day to transfer 1,100 records. For each of these flow runs, the respective Salesforce API formats the data differently. Some of the differences include how dates are formatted and null values are represented. Also, Bulk API 2.0 doesn't transfer Salesforce compound fields. By choosing this option, you optimize flow performance for both small and large data transfers, but the tradeoff is inconsistent formatting in the output. BULKV2 Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce Bulk API 2.0. This API runs asynchronous data transfers, and it's optimal for large sets of data. By choosing this option, you ensure that your flow writes consistent output, but you optimize performance only for large data transfers. Note that Bulk API 2.0 does not transfer Salesforce compound fields. REST_SYNC Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce REST API. By choosing this option, you ensure that your flow writes consistent output, but you decrease performance for large data transfers that are better suited for Bulk API 2.0. In some cases, if your flow attempts to transfer a vary large set of data, it might fail with a timed out error. Snowflake (dict) --- The properties required to query Snowflake.

If your flow transfers fewer than 1,000 records, Amazon AppFlow uses Salesforce REST API. If your flow transfers 1,000 records or more, Amazon AppFlow uses Salesforce Bulk API 2.0. Each of these Salesforce APIs structures data differently. If Amazon AppFlow selects the API automatically, be aware that, for recurring flows, the data output might vary from one flow run to the next. For example, if a flow runs daily, it might use REST API on one day to transfer 900 records, and it might use Bulk API 2.0 on the next day to transfer 1,100 records. For each of these flow runs, the respective Salesforce API formats the data differently. Some of the differences include how dates are formatted and null values are represented. Also, Bulk API 2.0 doesn't transfer Salesforce compound fields. By choosing this option, you optimize flow performance for both small and large data transfers, but the tradeoff is inconsistent formatting in the output. Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce Bulk API 2.0. This API runs asynchronous data transfers, and it's optimal for large sets of data. By choosing this option, you ensure that your flow writes consistent output, but you optimize performance only for large data transfers. Note that Bulk API 2.0 does not transfer Salesforce compound fields. Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce REST API. By choosing this option, you ensure that your flow writes consistent output, but you decrease performance for large data transfers that are better suited for Bulk API 2.0.
