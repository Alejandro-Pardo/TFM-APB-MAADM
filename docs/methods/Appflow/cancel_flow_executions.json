  "description": "Cancels active runs for a flow. You can cancel all of the active runs for a flow, or you can cancel specific runs by providing their IDs. You can cancel a flow run only when the run is in progress. You can't cancel a run that has already completed or failed. You also can't cancel a run that's scheduled to occur but hasn't started yet. To prevent a scheduled run, you can deactivate the flow with the StopFlow action. You cannot resume a run after you cancel it. When you send your request, the status for each run becomes CancelStarted. When the cancellation completes, the status becomes Canceled.",
