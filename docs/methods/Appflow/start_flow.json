For example, if you don't receive a response from your request, you can safely retry the request with the same clientToken parameter value. If you omit a clientToken value, the Amazon Web Services SDK that you are using inserts a value for you. This way, the SDK can safely retry requests multiple times after a network error. You must provide your own value for other use cases. If you specify input parameters that differ from your first request, an error occurs for flows that run on a schedule or based on an event. However, the error doesn't occur for flows that run on demand. You set the conditions that initiate your flow for the triggerConfig parameter. If you use a different value for clientToken, Amazon AppFlow considers it a new call to StartFlow. The token is active for 8 hours. This field is autopopulated if not provided.",
