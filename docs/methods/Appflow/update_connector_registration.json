For example, if you don't receive a response from your request, you can safely retry the request with the same clientToken parameter value. If you omit a clientToken value, the Amazon Web Services SDK that you are using inserts a value for you. This way, the SDK can safely retry requests multiple times after a network error. You must provide your own value for other use cases. If you specify input parameters that differ from your first request, an error occurs. If you use a different value for clientToken, Amazon AppFlow considers it a new call to UpdateConnectorRegistration. The token is active for 8 hours. This field is autopopulated if not provided.",
