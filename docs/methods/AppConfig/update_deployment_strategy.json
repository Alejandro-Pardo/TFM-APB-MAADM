      "description": "The algorithm used to define how percentage grows over time. AppConfig supports the following growth types: Linear: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment by increments of the growth factor evenly distributed over the deployment time. For example, a linear deployment that uses a growth factor of 20 initially makes the configuration available to 20 percent of the targets. After 1/5th of the deployment time has passed, the system updates the percentage to 40 percent. This continues until 100% of the targets are set to receive the deployed configuration. Exponential: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment exponentially using the following formula: G*(2^N). In this formula, G is the growth factor specified by the user and N is the number of steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For example, if you specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out the configuration as follows: 2*(2^0) 2*(2^1) 2*(2^2) Expressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of the targets, 4% of the targets, 8% of the targets, and continues until the configuration has been deployed to all targets.",
