      "description": "The new route specification to apply. This overwrites the existing data. grpcRoute (dict) --- An object that represents the specification of a gRPC route. An object that represents the action to take if a match is determined. An object that represents the targets that traffic is routed to when a request matches the route. (dict) --- An object that represents a target and its relative weight. Traffic is distributed across targets according to their relative weight. For example, a weighted target with a relative weight of 50 receives five times as much traffic as one with a relative weight of 10. The total weight for all targets combined must be less than or equal to 100. port (integer) --- The targeted port of the weighted object. The virtual node to associate with the weighted target. The relative weight of the weighted target. An object that represents the criteria for determining a request match. metadata (list) --- An object that represents the data to match from the request. (dict) --- An object that represents the match metadata for the route. invert (boolean) --- Specify True to match anything except the match criteria. The default value is False. match (dict) --- An object that represents the data to match from the request. exact (string) --- The value sent by the client must match the specified value exactly. prefix (string) --- The value sent by the client must begin with the specified characters. range (dict) --- An object that represents the range of values to match on. The end of the range. The start of the range. regex (string) --- The value sent by the client must include the specified characters. suffix (string) --- The value sent by the client must end with the specified characters. The name of the route. methodName (string) --- The method name to match from the request. If you specify a name, you must also specify a serviceName. port (integer) --- The port number to match on. serviceName (string) --- The fully qualified domain name for the service to match from the request. retryPolicy (dict) --- An object that represents a retry policy. grpcRetryEvents (list) --- Specify at least one of the valid values. (string) --- httpRetryEvents (list) --- Specify at least one of the following values. server-error --- HTTP status codes 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 510, and 511 gateway-error --- HTTP status codes 502, 503, and 504 client-error --- HTTP status code 409 stream-error --- Retry on refused stream (string) --- The maximum number of retry attempts. The timeout for each retry attempt. unit (string) --- A unit of time. value (integer) --- A number of time units. tcpRetryEvents (list) --- Specify a valid value. The event occurs before any processing of a request has started and is encountered when the upstream is temporarily or permanently unavailable. (string) --- timeout (dict) --- An object that represents types of timeouts. idle (dict) --- An object that represents an idle timeout. An idle timeout bounds the amount of time that a connection may be idle. The default value is none. perRequest (dict) --- An object that represents a per request timeout. The default value is 15 seconds. If you set a higher timeout, then make sure that the higher value is set for each App Mesh resource in a conversation. For example, if a virtual node backend uses a virtual router provider to route to another virtual node, then the timeout should be greater than 15 seconds for the source and destination virtual node and the route. http2Route (dict) --- An object that represents the specification of an HTTP/2 route. headers (list) --- The client request headers to match on. (dict) --- An object that represents the HTTP header in the request. match (dict) --- The HeaderMatchMethod object. A name for the HTTP header in the client request that will be matched on. method (string) --- The client request method to match on. Specify only one. path (dict) --- The client request path to match on. exact (string) --- The exact path to match on. regex (string) --- The regex used to match the path. prefix (string) --- Specifies the path to match requests with. This parameter must always start with /, which by itself matches all requests to the virtual service name. You can also match for path-based routing of requests. For example, if your virtual service name is my-service.local and you want the route to match requests to my-service.local/metrics, your prefix should be /metrics. queryParameters (list) --- The client request query parameters to match on. (dict) --- An object that represents the query parameter in the request. match (dict) --- The query parameter to match on. exact (string) --- The exact query parameter to match on. A name for the query parameter that will be matched on. scheme (string) --- The client request scheme to match on. Applicable only for HTTP2 routes. httpRetryEvents (list) --- Specify at least one of the following values. httpRoute (dict) --- An object that represents the specification of an HTTP route. priority (integer) --- The priority for the route. Routes are matched based on the specified value, where 0 is the highest priority. tcpRoute (dict) --- An object that represents the specification of a TCP route. The action to take if a match is determined. match (dict) --- An object that represents the criteria for determining a request match. timeout (dict) --- An object that represents types of timeouts. value (integer) --- A number of time units.",
