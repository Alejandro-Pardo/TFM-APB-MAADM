The certificate must meet specific requirements and you must have proxy authorization enabled. For more information, see Transport Layer Security (TLS). The certificate chain for the certificate. The private key for a certificate stored on the file system of the virtual node that the proxy is running on. sds (dict) --- A reference to an object that represents a client's TLS Secret Discovery Service certificate. A reference to an object that represents the name of the secret requested from the Secret Discovery Service provider representing Transport Layer Security (TLS) materials like a certificate or certificate chain. enforce (boolean) --- Whether the policy is enforced. The default is True, if a value isn't specified. ports (list) --- One or more ports that the policy is enforced for. (integer) --- A reference to an object that represents a TLS validation context. subjectAlternativeNames (dict) --- A reference to an object that represents the SANs for a Transport Layer Security (TLS) validation context. If you don't specify SANs on the terminating mesh endpoint, the Envoy proxy for that node doesn't verify the SAN on a peer client certificate. If you don't specify SANs on the originating mesh endpoint, the SAN on the certificate provided by the terminating endpoint must match the mesh endpoint service discovery configuration. Since SPIRE vended certificates have a SPIFFE ID as a name, you must set the SAN since the name doesn't match the service discovery name. An object that represents the criteria for determining a SANs match. The values sent must match the specified values exactly. (string) --- A reference to where to retrieve the trust chain when validating a peer's Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate. acm (dict) --- A reference to an object that represents a Transport Layer Security (TLS) validation context trust for an Certificate Manager certificate. One or more ACM Amazon Resource Name (ARN)s. (string) --- file (dict) --- An object that represents a Transport Layer Security (TLS) validation context trust for a local file.

The name of the virtual service that is acting as a virtual node backend. listeners (list) --- The listener that the virtual node is expected to receive inbound traffic from.

Maximum number of inflight requests Envoy can concurrently support across hosts in upstream cluster. http (dict) --- An object that represents a type of connection pool. Maximum number of outbound TCP connections Envoy can establish concurrently with all hosts in upstream cluster. maxPendingRequests (integer) --- Number of overflowing requests after max_connections Envoy will queue to upstream cluster. http2 (dict) --- An object that represents a type of connection pool. tcp (dict) --- An object that represents a type of connection pool. healthCheck (dict) --- The health check information for the listener. The number of consecutive successful health checks that must occur before declaring listener healthy. The time period in milliseconds between each health check execution. path (string) --- The destination path for the health check request. This value is only used if the specified protocol is HTTP or HTTP/2. For any other protocol, this value is ignored. port (integer) --- The destination port for the health check request. This port must match the port defined in the  PortMapping for the listener. The protocol for the health check request. If you specify grpc, then your service must conform to the GRPC Health Checking Protocol. The amount of time to wait when receiving a response from the health check, in milliseconds. The number of consecutive failed health checks that must occur before declaring a virtual node unhealthy. outlierDetection (dict) --- The outlier detection information for the listener.

Number of consecutive 5xx errors required for ejection. The port mapping information for the listener. The port used for the port mapping. The protocol used for the port mapping. Specify one protocol. timeout (dict) --- An object that represents timeouts for different protocols. grpc (dict) --- An object that represents types of timeouts. idle (dict) --- An object that represents an idle timeout. An idle timeout bounds the amount of time that a connection may be idle. The default value is none. perRequest (dict) --- An object that represents a per request timeout. The default value is 15 seconds. If you set a higher timeout, then make sure that the higher value is set for each App Mesh resource in a conversation. For example, if a virtual node backend uses a virtual router provider to route to another virtual node, then the timeout should be greater than 15 seconds for the source and destination virtual node and the route. http (dict) --- An object that represents types of timeouts. http2 (dict) --- An object that represents types of timeouts. tcp (dict) --- An object that represents types of timeouts. tls (dict) --- A reference to an object that represents the Transport Layer Security (TLS) properties for a listener.

The specified value for the JSON. text (string) --- The file path to write access logs to. You can use /dev/stdout to send access logs to standard out and configure your Envoy container to use a log driver, such as awslogs, to export the access logs to a log storage service such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs. You can also specify a path in the Envoy container's file system to write the files to disk. serviceDiscovery (dict) --- The service discovery information for the virtual node. If your virtual node does not expect ingress traffic, you can omit this parameter. If you specify a listener, then you must specify service discovery information. awsCloudMap (dict) --- Specifies any Cloud Map information for the virtual node. attributes (list) --- A string map that contains attributes with values that you can use to filter instances by any custom attribute that you specified when you registered the instance. Only instances that match all of the specified key/value pairs will be returned. (dict) --- An object that represents the Cloud Map attribute information for your virtual node. The name of an Cloud Map service instance attribute key. Any Cloud Map service instance that contains the specified key and value is returned.
