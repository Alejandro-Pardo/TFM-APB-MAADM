  "description": "Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces route. The account owner of the service resource is always the environment owner, regardless of which account creates the route. Routes target a service in the application. If an application does not have any routes, then the first route must be created as a DEFAULT RouteType. When created, the default route defaults to an active state so state is not a required input. However, like all other state values the state of the default route can be updated after creation, but only when all other routes are also inactive. Conversely, no route can be active without the default route also being active. When you create a route, Refactor Spaces configures the Amazon API Gateway to send traffic to the target service as follows: When you create environments without a network bridge ( CreateEnvironment:NetworkFabricType is NONE) and you use your own networking infrastructure, you need to configure VPC to VPC connectivity between your network and the application proxy VPC. Route creation from the application proxy to service endpoints will fail if your network is not configured to connect to the application proxy VPC. For more information, see Create a route in the Refactor Spaces User Guide.",
