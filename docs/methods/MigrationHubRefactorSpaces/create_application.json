  "description": "Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces application. The account that owns the environment also owns the applications created inside the environment, regardless of the account that creates the application. Refactor Spaces provisions an Amazon API Gateway, API Gateway VPC link, and Network Load Balancer for the application proxy inside your account. In environments created with a CreateEnvironment:NetworkFabricType of NONE you need to configure VPC to VPC connectivity between your service VPC and the application proxy VPC to route traffic through the application proxy to a service with a private URL endpoint. For more information, see Create an application in the Refactor Spaces User Guide.",
