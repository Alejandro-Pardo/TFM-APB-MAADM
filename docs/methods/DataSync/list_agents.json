  "description": "Returns a list of DataSync agents that belong to an Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region specified in the request. With pagination, you can reduce the number of agents returned in a response. If you get a truncated list of agents in a response, the response contains a marker that you can specify in your next request to fetch the next page of agents. ListAgents is eventually consistent. This means the result of running the operation might not reflect that you just created or deleted an agent. For example, if you create an agent with CreateAgent and then immediately run ListAgents, that agent might not show up in the list right away. In situations like this, you can always confirm whether an agent has been created (or deleted) by using DescribeAgent.",
