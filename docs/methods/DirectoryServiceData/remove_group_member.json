A client token is valid for 8 hours after the first request that uses it completes. After 8 hours, any request with the same client token is treated as a new request. If the request succeeds, any future uses of that token will be idempotent for another 8 hours. If you submit a request with the same client token but change one of the other parameters within the 8-hour idempotency window, Directory Service Data returns an ConflictException.
