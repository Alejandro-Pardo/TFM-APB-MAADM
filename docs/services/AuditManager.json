    "description": "A low-level client representing AWS Audit Manager Welcome to the Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Audit Manager API operations, data types, and errors. Audit Manager is a service that provides automated evidence collection so that you can continually audit your Amazon Web Services usage.

These controls are grouped according to the requirements of the specified compliance standard or regulation. You can also customize frameworks and controls to support internal audits with specific requirements. Use the following links to get started with the Audit Manager API: Actions: An alphabetical list of all Audit Manager API operations. Data types: An alphabetical list of all Audit Manager data types. Common parameters: Parameters that all operations can use. Common errors: Client and server errors that all operations can return.
