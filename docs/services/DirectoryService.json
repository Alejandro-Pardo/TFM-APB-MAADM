This guide provides detailed information about Directory Service operations, data types, parameters, and errors. For information about Directory Services features, see Directory Service and the Directory Service Administration Guide. Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Directory Service and other Amazon Web Services services. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.",
