    "description": "A low-level client representing Payment Cryptography Data Plane You use the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Data Plane to manage how encryption keys are used for payment-related transaction processing and associated cryptographic operations. You can encrypt, decrypt, generate, verify, and translate payment-related cryptographic operations in Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. For more information, see Data operations in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. To manage your encryption keys, you use the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane. You can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can also manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for keys.",
