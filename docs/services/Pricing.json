    "description": "A low-level client representing AWS Price List Service (Pricing) The Amazon Web Services Price List API is a centralized and convenient way to programmatically query Amazon Web Services for services, products, and pricing information. The Amazon Web Services Price List uses standardized product attributes such as Location, Storage Class, and Operating System, and provides prices at the SKU level. You can use the Amazon Web Services Price List to do the following: Build cost control and scenario planning tools Reconcile billing data Forecast future spend for budgeting purposes Provide cost benefit analysis that compare your internal workloads with Amazon Web Services Use GetServices without a service code to retrieve the service codes for all Amazon Web Services services, then GetServices with a service code to retrieve the attribute names for that service. After you have the service code and attribute names, you can use GetAttributeValues to see what values are available for an attribute. With the service code and an attribute name and value, you can use GetProducts to find specific products that you're interested in, such as an AmazonEC2 instance, with a Provisioned IOPS volumeType. For more information, see Using the Amazon Web Services Price List API in the Billing User Guide.",
