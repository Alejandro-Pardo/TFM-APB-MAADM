    "with_service_params": "Service: Dynamo DB. A low-level client representing Amazon Dynamo DB Amazon Dynamo DB is a fully managed No SQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. Dynamo DB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling. With Dynamo DB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics. Dynamo DB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SS Ds) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability. Method: create table. The Create Table operation adds a new table to your account. In an Amazon Web Services account, table names must be unique within each Region. That is, you can have two tables with same name if you create the tables in different Regions. Create Table is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a Create Table request, Dynamo DB immediately returns a response with a Table Status of CREATING. After the table is created, Dynamo DB sets the Table Status to ACTIVE. You can perform read and write operations only on an ACTIVE table. You can optionally define secondary indexes on the new table, as part of the Create Table operation. If you want to create multiple tables with secondary indexes on them, you must create the tables sequentially. Only one table with secondary indexes can be in the CREATING state at any given time. You can use the Describe Table action to check the table status. Parameters: Attribute Definitions: An array of attributes that describe the key schema for the table and indexes. Represents an attribute for describing the schema for the table and indexes. A name for the attribute. The data type for the attribute, where: S - the attribute is of type String N - the attribute is of type Number B - the attribute is of type Binary. | Table Name: The name of the table to create. You can also provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter. | Key Schema: Specifies the attributes that make up the primary key for a table or an index. The attributes in Key Schema must also be defined in the Attribute Definitions array. For more information, see Data Model in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Each Key Schema Element in the array is composed of: Attribute Name - The name of this key attribute. Key Type - The role that the key attribute will assume: HASH - partition key RANGE - sort key For a simple primary key (partition key), you must provide exactly one element with a Key Type of HASH. For a composite primary key (partition key and sort key), you must provide exactly two elements, in this order: The first element must have a Key Type of HASH, and the second element must have a Key Type of RANGE. For more information, see Working with Tables in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents a single element of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index. A Key Schema Element represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one Key Schema Element (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one Key Schema Element for the partition key, and another Key Schema Element for the sort key. A Key Schema Element must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.

Each local secondary index in the array includes the following: Index Name - The name of the local secondary index. Must be unique only for this table. Key Schema - Specifies the key schema for the local secondary index. The key schema must begin with the same partition key as the table. Projection - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the index.

INCLUDE - Only the specified table attributes are projected into the index. The list of projected attributes is in Non Key Attributes. ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into the index. Non Key Attributes - A list of one or more non-key attribute names that are projected into the secondary index. The total count of attributes provided in Non Key Attributes, summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total. This limit only applies when you specify the Projection Type of INCLUDE.

Valid values for Stream View Type are: KEYS_ONLY - Only the key attributes of the modified item are written to the stream.

Amazon Web Services-assigned tag names do not count towards the tag limit of 50. User-assigned tag names have the prefix user: in the Cost Allocation Report. You cannot backdate the application of a tag. For an overview on tagging Dynamo DB resources, see Tagging for Dynamo DB in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. The key of the tag.

Tag keys are case sensitive. Each Dynamo DB table can only have up to one tag with the same key. If you try to add an existing tag (same key), the existing tag value will be updated to the new value. The value of the tag. Tag values are case-sensitive and can be null. | Table Class | Deletion Protection Enabled | Warm Throughput: Represents the warm throughput (in read units per second and write units per second) for creating a table. Read Units Per Second Represents the number of read operations your base table can instantaneously support. Write Units Per Second Represents the number of write operations your base table can instantaneously support. | Resource Policy: An Amazon Web Services resource-based policy document in JSON format that will be attached to the table. When you attach a resource-based policy while creating a table, the policy application is strongly consistent. The maximum size supported for a resource-based policy document is 20 KB. Dynamo DB counts whitespaces when calculating the size of a policy against this limit. For a full list of all considerations that apply for resource-based policies, see Resource-based policy considerations. | On Demand Throughput: Sets the maximum number of read and write units for the specified table in on-demand capacity mode. If you use this parameter, you must specify Max Read Request Units, Max Write Request Units, or both. Max Read Request Units Maximum number of read request units for the specified table. To specify a maximum On Demand Throughput on your table, set the value of Max Read Request Units as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum On Demand Throughput that is currently set on your table, set the value of Max Read Request Units to -1. Max Write Request Units Maximum number of write request units for the specified table. To specify a maximum On Demand Throughput on your table, set the value of Max Write Request Units as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum On Demand Throughput that is currently set on your table, set the value of Max Write Request Units to -1. Returns: Table Description: Represents the properties of the table."
