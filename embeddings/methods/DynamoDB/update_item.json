For more information, see Attribute Updates in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. For the Update Item operation, represents the attributes to be modified, the action to perform on each, and the new value for each. Attribute values cannot be null; string and binary type attributes must have lengths greater than zero; and set type attributes must not be empty.

The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself. For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. S An attribute of type String. For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, Dynamo DB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations. B An attribute of type Binary.

For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true Action Specifies how to perform the update. Valid values are PUT (default), DELETE, and ADD. The behavior depends on whether the specified primary key already exists in the table. If an item with the specified Key is found in the table: PUT - Adds the specified attribute to the item. If the attribute already exists, it is replaced by the new value. DELETE - If no value is specified, the attribute and its value are removed from the item. The data type of the specified value must match the existing value's data type. If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set [a,b,c] and the DELETE action specified [a,c], then the final attribute value would be [b]. Specifying an empty set is an error. ADD - If the attribute does not already exist, then the attribute and its values are added to the item. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of ADD depends on the data type of the attribute: If the existing attribute is a number, and if Value is also a number, then the Value is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If Value is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute. If the existing data type is a set, and if the Value is also a set, then the Value is added to the existing set. (This is a set operation, not mathematical addition.) For example, if the attribute value was the set [1,2], and the ADD action specified [3], then the final attribute value would be [1,2,3]. An error occurs if an Add action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the Value must also be a set of strings. The same holds true for number sets and binary sets. This action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data type is number or is a set. Do not use ADD for any other data types. If no item with the specified Key is found: PUT - Dynamo DB creates a new item with the specified primary key, and then adds the attribute. DELETE - Nothing happens; there is no attribute to delete. ADD - Dynamo DB creates a new item with the supplied primary key and number (or set) for the attribute value. The only data types allowed are number, number set, string set or binary set. | Expected: This is a legacy parameter. Use Condition Expression instead. For more information, see Expected in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents a condition to be compared with an attribute value. This condition can be used with Delete Item, Put Item, or Update Item operations; if the comparison evaluates to true, the operation succeeds; if not, the operation fails. You can use Expected Attribute Value in one of two different ways: Use Attribute Value List to specify one or more values to compare against an attribute. Use Comparison Operator to specify how you want to perform the comparison. If the comparison evaluates to true, then the conditional operation succeeds. Use Value to specify a value that Dynamo DB will compare against an attribute. If the values match, then Expected Attribute Value evaluates to true and the conditional operation succeeds. Optionally, you can also set Exists to false, indicating that you do not expect to find the attribute value in the table. In this case, the conditional operation succeeds only if the comparison evaluates to false. Value and Exists are incompatible with Attribute Value List and Comparison Operator. Note that if you use both sets of parameters at once, Dynamo DB will return a Validation Exception exception. Value Represents the data for the expected attribute. Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself. For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. S An attribute of type String. For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, Dynamo DB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations. B An attribute of type Binary. For example: \"B\": \"dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk\" SS An attribute of type String Set. For example: \"SS\": [\"Giraffe\", \"Hippo\" ,\"Zebra\"] NS An attribute of type Number Set. For example: \"NS\": [\"42.2\", \"-19\", \"7.5\", \"3.14\"] Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. BS An attribute of type Binary Set. For example: \"BS\": [\"U3Vubnk=\", \"Um Fpbnk=\", \"U25vd3k=\"] M An attribute of type Map. For example: \"M\": {\"Name\": {\"S\": \"Joe\"}, \"Age\": {\"N\": \"35\"}} Represents the data for an attribute. L An attribute of type List. For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true Exists Causes Dynamo DB to evaluate the value before attempting a conditional operation: If Exists is true, Dynamo DB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the operation succeeds. If it is not found, the operation fails with a Condition Check Failed Exception. If Exists is false, Dynamo DB assumes that the attribute value does not exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the operation succeeds. If the value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the operation fails with a Condition Check Failed Exception. The default setting for Exists is true. If you supply a Value all by itself, Dynamo DB assumes the attribute exists: You don't have to set Exists to true, because it is implied. Dynamo DB returns a Validation Exception if: Exists is true but there is no Value to check. (You expect a value to exist, but don't specify what that value is.) Exists is false but you also provide a Value. (You cannot expect an attribute to have a value, while also expecting it not to exist.) Comparison Operator A comparator for evaluating attributes in the Attribute Value List. For example, equals, greater than, less than, etc. The following comparison operators are available: EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN The following are descriptions of each comparison operator. EQ : Equal. EQ is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an Attribute Value element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {\"S\":\"6\"} does not equal {\"N\":\"6\"}. Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not equal {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}. NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an Attribute Value of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. LE : Less than or equal. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}. LT : Less than. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). GE : Greater than or equal. GT : Greater than. NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. NULL : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. CONTAINS : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (' SS', ' NS', or ' BS'), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating ' a CONTAINS b', ' a' can be a list; however, ' b' cannot be a set, a map, or a list. NOT_CONTAINS : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set. If the target attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (' SS', ' NS', or ' BS'), then the operator evaluates to true if it does not find an exact match with any member of the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating ' a NOT CONTAINS b', ' a' can be a list; however, ' b' cannot be a set, a map, or a list. BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). IN : Checks for matching elements in a list. Attribute Value List can contain one or more Attribute Value elements of type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes are compared against an existing attribute of an item. If any elements of the input are equal to the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true. BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. Attribute Value List must contain two Attribute Value elements of the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second element. For example, {\"S\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"N\":\"6\"}. Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]} Attribute Value List One or more values to evaluate against the supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the Comparison Operator being used. For type Number, value comparisons are numeric. String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a is greater than A, and a is greater than B. For a list of code values, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters. For Binary, Dynamo DB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned when it compares binary values. For information on specifying data types in JSON, see JSON Data Format in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents the data for an attribute. For example: \"BOOL\": true. | Conditional Operator | Return Values: Use Return Values if you want to get the item attributes as they appear before or after they are successfully updated. For Update Item, the valid values are: NONE - If Return Values is not specified, or if its value is NONE, then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for Return Values.) ALL_OLD - Returns all of the attributes of the item, as they appeared before the Update Item operation. UPDATED_OLD - Returns only the updated attributes, as they appeared before the Update Item operation. ALL_NEW - Returns all of the attributes of the item, as they appear after the Update Item operation. UPDATED_NEW - Returns only the updated attributes, as they appear after the Update Item operation. There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed. The values returned are strongly consistent. | Return Consumed Capacity: Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput consumption that is returned in the response: INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate Consumed Capacity for the operation, together with Consumed Capacity for each table and secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such as Get Item and Batch Get Item, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying INDEXES will only return Consumed Capacity information for table(s). TOTAL - The response includes only the aggregate Consumed Capacity for the operation. NONE - No Consumed Capacity details are included in the response. | Return Item Collection Metrics | Update Expression: An expression that defines one or more attributes to be updated, the action to be performed on them, and new values for them. The following action values are available for Update Expression. SET - Adds one or more attributes and values to an item. If any of these attributes already exist, they are replaced by the new values. You can also use SET to add or subtract from an attribute that is of type Number. For example: SET myNum = myNum + :val SET supports the following functions: if_not_exists (path, operand) - if the item does not contain an attribute at the specified path, then if_not_exists evaluates to operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be present in the item. list_append (operand, operand) - evaluates to a list with a new element added to it. You can append the new element to the start or the end of the list by reversing the order of the operands. These function names are case-sensitive. REMOVE - Removes one or more attributes from an item. ADD - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of ADD depends on the data type of the attribute: If the existing attribute is a number, and if Value is also a number, then Value is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If Value is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute. If the existing data type is a set and if Value is also a set, then Value is added to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set [1,2], and the ADD action specified [3], then the final attribute value is [1,2,3]. An error occurs if an ADD action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the Value must also be a set of strings. DELETE - Deletes an element from a set. If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set [a,b,c] and the DELETE action specifies [a,c], then the final attribute value is [b]. Specifying an empty set is an error. You can have many actions in a single expression, such as the following: SET a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4, :value5 For more information on update expressions, see Modifying Items and Attributes in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Condition Expression: A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional update to succeed. An expression can contain any of the following: Functions: attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | attribute_type | contains | begins_with | size These function names are case-sensitive. Comparison operators: = | <> | < | > | <= | >= | BETWEEN | IN Logical operators: AND | OR | NOT For more information about condition expressions, see Specifying Conditions in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Expression Attribute Names: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using Expression Attribute Names: To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a Dynamo DB reserved word. To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression. To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression. Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name: Percentile The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide.) To work around this, you could specify the following for Expression Attribute Names: {\"#P\":\"Percentile\"} You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example: #P = :val For more information about expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Expression Attribute Values: One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the Product Status attribute was one of the following: Available | Backordered | Discontinued You would first need to specify Expression Attribute Values as follows: { \":avail\":{\"S\":\"Available\"}, \":back\":{\"S\":\"Backordered\"}, \":disc\":{\"S\":\"Discontinued\"} } You could then use these values in an expression, such as this: Product Status IN (:avail, :back, :disc) For more information on expression attribute values, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

BS An attribute of type Binary Set. For example: \"BS\": [\"U3Vubnk=\", \"Um Fpbnk=\", \"U25vd3k=\"] M An attribute of type Map. For example: \"M\": {\"Name\": {\"S\": \"Joe\"}, \"Age\": {\"N\": \"35\"}} Represents the data for an attribute. L An attribute of type List. For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true Exists Causes Dynamo DB to evaluate the value before attempting a conditional operation: If Exists is true, Dynamo DB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the operation succeeds. If it is not found, the operation fails with a Condition Check Failed Exception. If Exists is false, Dynamo DB assumes that the attribute value does not exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the operation succeeds. If the value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the operation fails with a Condition Check Failed Exception. The default setting for Exists is true. If you supply a Value all by itself, Dynamo DB assumes the attribute exists: You don't have to set Exists to true, because it is implied. Dynamo DB returns a Validation Exception if: Exists is true but there is no Value to check. (You expect a value to exist, but don't specify what that value is.) Exists is false but you also provide a Value. (You cannot expect an attribute to have a value, while also expecting it not to exist.) Comparison Operator A comparator for evaluating attributes in the Attribute Value List. For example, equals, greater than, less than, etc. The following comparison operators are available: EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN The following are descriptions of each comparison operator. EQ : Equal. EQ is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an Attribute Value element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {\"S\":\"6\"} does not equal {\"N\":\"6\"}. Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not equal {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}. NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an Attribute Value of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. LE : Less than or equal. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}. LT : Less than. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). GE : Greater than or equal. GT : Greater than. NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. NULL : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. CONTAINS : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (' SS', ' NS', or ' BS'), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating ' a CONTAINS b', ' a' can be a list; however, ' b' cannot be a set, a map, or a list. NOT_CONTAINS : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set. If the target attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (' SS', ' NS', or ' BS'), then the operator evaluates to true if it does not find an exact match with any member of the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating ' a NOT CONTAINS b', ' a' can be a list; however, ' b' cannot be a set, a map, or a list. BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). IN : Checks for matching elements in a list. Attribute Value List can contain one or more Attribute Value elements of type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes are compared against an existing attribute of an item. If any elements of the input are equal to the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true. BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. Attribute Value List must contain two Attribute Value elements of the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second element. For example, {\"S\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"N\":\"6\"}. Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]} Attribute Value List One or more values to evaluate against the supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the Comparison Operator being used. For type Number, value comparisons are numeric. String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a is greater than A, and a is greater than B. For a list of code values, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters. For Binary, Dynamo DB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned when it compares binary values. For information on specifying data types in JSON, see JSON Data Format in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents the data for an attribute. For example: \"BOOL\": true. | Conditional Operator | Return Values: Use Return Values if you want to get the item attributes as they appear before or after they are successfully updated. For Update Item, the valid values are: NONE - If Return Values is not specified, or if its value is NONE, then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for Return Values.) ALL_OLD - Returns all of the attributes of the item, as they appeared before the Update Item operation. UPDATED_OLD - Returns only the updated attributes, as they appeared before the Update Item operation. ALL_NEW - Returns all of the attributes of the item, as they appear after the Update Item operation. UPDATED_NEW - Returns only the updated attributes, as they appear after the Update Item operation. There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed. The values returned are strongly consistent. | Return Consumed Capacity: Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput consumption that is returned in the response: INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate Consumed Capacity for the operation, together with Consumed Capacity for each table and secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such as Get Item and Batch Get Item, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying INDEXES will only return Consumed Capacity information for table(s). TOTAL - The response includes only the aggregate Consumed Capacity for the operation. NONE - No Consumed Capacity details are included in the response. | Return Item Collection Metrics | Update Expression: An expression that defines one or more attributes to be updated, the action to be performed on them, and new values for them. The following action values are available for Update Expression. SET - Adds one or more attributes and values to an item. If any of these attributes already exist, they are replaced by the new values. You can also use SET to add or subtract from an attribute that is of type Number. For example: SET myNum = myNum + :val SET supports the following functions: if_not_exists (path, operand) - if the item does not contain an attribute at the specified path, then if_not_exists evaluates to operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be present in the item. list_append (operand, operand) - evaluates to a list with a new element added to it. You can append the new element to the start or the end of the list by reversing the order of the operands. These function names are case-sensitive. REMOVE - Removes one or more attributes from an item. ADD - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of ADD depends on the data type of the attribute: If the existing attribute is a number, and if Value is also a number, then Value is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If Value is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute. If the existing data type is a set and if Value is also a set, then Value is added to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set [1,2], and the ADD action specified [3], then the final attribute value is [1,2,3]. An error occurs if an ADD action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the Value must also be a set of strings. DELETE - Deletes an element from a set. If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set [a,b,c] and the DELETE action specifies [a,c], then the final attribute value is [b]. Specifying an empty set is an error. You can have many actions in a single expression, such as the following: SET a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4, :value5 For more information on update expressions, see Modifying Items and Attributes in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Condition Expression: A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional update to succeed. An expression can contain any of the following: Functions: attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | attribute_type | contains | begins_with | size These function names are case-sensitive. Comparison operators: = | <> | < | > | <= | >= | BETWEEN | IN Logical operators: AND | OR | NOT For more information about condition expressions, see Specifying Conditions in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Expression Attribute Names: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using Expression Attribute Names: To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a Dynamo DB reserved word. To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression. To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression. Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name: Percentile The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide.) To work around this, you could specify the following for Expression Attribute Names: {\"#P\":\"Percentile\"} You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example: #P = :val For more information about expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Expression Attribute Values: One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the Product Status attribute was one of the following: Available | Backordered | Discontinued You would first need to specify Expression Attribute Values as follows: { \":avail\":{\"S\":\"Available\"}, \":back\":{\"S\":\"Backordered\"}, \":disc\":{\"S\":\"Discontinued\"} } You could then use these values in an expression, such as this: Product Status IN (:avail, :back, :disc) For more information on expression attribute values, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself. For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. S An attribute of type String. For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, Dynamo DB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations. B An attribute of type Binary. For example: \"B\": \"dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk\" SS An attribute of type String Set. For example: \"SS\": [\"Giraffe\", \"Hippo\" ,\"Zebra\"] NS An attribute of type Number Set. For example: \"NS\": [\"42.2\", \"-19\", \"7.5\", \"3.14\"] Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. BS An attribute of type Binary Set. For example: \"BS\": [\"U3Vubnk=\", \"Um Fpbnk=\", \"U25vd3k=\"] M An attribute of type Map. For example: \"M\": {\"Name\": {\"S\": \"Joe\"}, \"Age\": {\"N\": \"35\"}} Represents the data for an attribute. L An attribute of type List. For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true. | Return Values On Condition Check Failure: An optional parameter that returns the item attributes for an Update Item operation that failed a condition check. There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed. Returns: Attributes: A map of attribute values as they appear before or after the Update Item operation, as determined by the Return Values parameter. | Consumed Capacity: The capacity units consumed by the Update Item operation. The data returned includes the total provisioned throughput consumed, along with statistics for the table and any indexes involved in the operation. Consumed Capacity is only returned if the Return Consumed Capacity parameter was specified. For more information, see Capacity unity consumption for write operations in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Item Collection Metrics: Information about item collections, if any, that were affected by the Update Item operation. Item Collection Metrics is only returned if the Return Item Collection Metrics parameter was specified. If the table does not have any local secondary indexes, this information is not returned in the response."
