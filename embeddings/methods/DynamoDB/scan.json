To have Dynamo DB return fewer items, you can provide a Filter Expression operation. If the total size of scanned items exceeds the maximum dataset size limit of 1 MB, the scan completes and results are returned to the user. The Last Evaluated Key value is also returned and the requestor can use the Last Evaluated Key to continue the scan in a subsequent operation. Each scan response also includes number of items that were scanned (Scanned Count) as part of the request. If using a Filter Expression, a scan result can result in no items meeting the criteria and the Count will result in zero. If you did not use a Filter Expression in the scan request, then Count is the same as Scanned Count. A single Scan operation first reads up to the maximum number of items set (if using the Limit parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then applies any filtering to the results if a Filter Expression is provided. If Last Evaluated Key is present in the response, pagination is required to complete the full table scan. For more information, see Paginating the Results in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Scan operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster performance on a large table or secondary index, applications can request a parallel Scan operation by providing the Segment and Total Segments parameters. For more information, see Parallel Scan in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. By default, a Scan uses eventually consistent reads when accessing the items in a table. Therefore, the results from an eventually consistent Scan may not include the latest item changes at the time the scan iterates through each item in the table.

    "with_service_params": "Service: Dynamo DB. A low-level client representing Amazon Dynamo DB Amazon Dynamo DB is a fully managed No SQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. Dynamo DB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling. With Dynamo DB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics. Dynamo DB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SS Ds) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability. Method: scan. The Scan operation returns one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item in a table or a secondary index. To have Dynamo DB return fewer items, you can provide a Filter Expression operation. If the total size of scanned items exceeds the maximum dataset size limit of 1 MB, the scan completes and results are returned to the user. The Last Evaluated Key value is also returned and the requestor can use the Last Evaluated Key to continue the scan in a subsequent operation. Each scan response also includes number of items that were scanned (Scanned Count) as part of the request.

A single Scan operation first reads up to the maximum number of items set (if using the Limit parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then applies any filtering to the results if a Filter Expression is provided. If Last Evaluated Key is present in the response, pagination is required to complete the full table scan. For more information, see Paginating the Results in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Scan operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster performance on a large table or secondary index, applications can request a parallel Scan operation by providing the Segment and Total Segments parameters. For more information, see Parallel Scan in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. By default, a Scan uses eventually consistent reads when accessing the items in a table. Therefore, the results from an eventually consistent Scan may not include the latest item changes at the time the scan iterates through each item in the table. If you require a strongly consistent read of each item as the scan iterates through the items in the table, you can set the Consistent Read parameter to true. Strong consistency only relates to the consistency of the read at the item level. Parameters: Table Name: The name of the table containing the requested items or if you provide Index Name, the name of the table to which that index belongs. You can also provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter. | Index Name | Attributes To Get: This is a legacy parameter. Use Projection Expression instead. For more information, see Attributes To Get in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Limit | Select: The attributes to be returned in the result. You can retrieve all item attributes, specific item attributes, the count of matching items, or in the case of an index, some or all of the attributes projected into the index. ALL_ATTRIBUTES - Returns all of the item attributes from the specified table or index. If you query a local secondary index, then for each matching item in the index, Dynamo DB fetches the entire item from the parent table. If the index is configured to project all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required. ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES - Allowed only when querying an index. Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the index. If the index is configured to project all attributes, this return value is equivalent to specifying ALL_ATTRIBUTES. COUNT - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the matching items themselves. Note that this uses the same quantity of read capacity units as getting the items, and is subject to the same item size calculations. SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES - Returns only the attributes listed in Projection Expression. This return value is equivalent to specifying Projection Expression without specifying any value for Select. If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected into that index, the operation reads only the index and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, Dynamo DB fetches each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency. If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent table. If neither Select nor Projection Expression are specified, Dynamo DB defaults to ALL_ATTRIBUTES when accessing a table, and ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES when accessing an index. You cannot use both Select and Projection Expression together in a single request, unless the value for Select is SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. (This usage is equivalent to specifying Projection Expression without any value for Select.) | Scan Filter: This is a legacy parameter. Use Filter Expression instead. For more information, see Scan Filter in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents the selection criteria for a Query or Scan operation: For a Query operation, Condition is used for specifying the Key Conditions to use when querying a table or an index. For Key Conditions, only the following comparison operators are supported: EQ | LE | LT | GE | GT | BEGINS_WITH | BETWEEN Condition is also used in a Query Filter, which evaluates the query results and returns only the desired values. For a Scan operation, Condition is used in a Scan Filter, which evaluates the scan results and returns only the desired values. Attribute Value List One or more values to evaluate against the supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the Comparison Operator being used. For type Number, value comparisons are numeric. String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a is greater than A, and a is greater than B. For a list of code values, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters. For Binary, Dynamo DB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned when it compares binary values. Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself. For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. S An attribute of type String. For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, Dynamo DB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations. B An attribute of type Binary. For example: \"B\": \"dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk\" SS An attribute of type String Set. For example: \"SS\": [\"Giraffe\", \"Hippo\" ,\"Zebra\"] NS An attribute of type Number Set. For example: \"NS\": [\"42.2\", \"-19\", \"7.5\", \"3.14\"] Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. BS An attribute of type Binary Set. For example: \"BS\": [\"U3Vubnk=\", \"Um Fpbnk=\", \"U25vd3k=\"] M An attribute of type Map. For example: \"M\": {\"Name\": {\"S\": \"Joe\"}, \"Age\": {\"N\": \"35\"}} Represents the data for an attribute. L An attribute of type List. For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true A comparator for evaluating attributes. For example, equals, greater than, less than, etc. The following comparison operators are available: EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN The following are descriptions of each comparison operator. EQ : Equal. EQ is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an Attribute Value element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {\"S\":\"6\"} does not equal {\"N\":\"6\"}. Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not equal {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}. NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an Attribute Value of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. LE : Less than or equal. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}. LT : Less than. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). GE : Greater than or equal. GT : Greater than. NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. NULL : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. CONTAINS : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (' SS', ' NS', or ' BS'), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating ' a CONTAINS b', ' a' can be a list; however, ' b' cannot be a set, a map, or a list. NOT_CONTAINS : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set. If the target attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (' SS', ' NS', or ' BS'), then the operator evaluates to true if it does not find an exact match with any member of the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating ' a NOT CONTAINS b', ' a' can be a list; however, ' b' cannot be a set, a map, or a list. BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). IN : Checks for matching elements in a list. Attribute Value List can contain one or more Attribute Value elements of type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes are compared against an existing attribute of an item. If any elements of the input are equal to the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true. BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. Attribute Value List must contain two Attribute Value elements of the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second element. For example, {\"S\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"N\":\"6\"}. Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]} For usage examples of Attribute Value List and Comparison Operator, see Legacy Conditional Parameters in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Conditional Operator | Exclusive Start Key: The primary key of the first item that this operation will evaluate. Use the value that was returned for Last Evaluated Key in the previous operation. The data type for Exclusive Start Key must be String, Number or Binary. No set data types are allowed. In a parallel scan, a Scan request that includes Exclusive Start Key must specify the same segment whose previous Scan returned the corresponding value of Last Evaluated Key. Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself. For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. S An attribute of type String. For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, Dynamo DB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations. B An attribute of type Binary. For example: \"B\": \"dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk\" SS An attribute of type String Set. For example: \"SS\": [\"Giraffe\", \"Hippo\" ,\"Zebra\"] NS An attribute of type Number Set. For example: \"NS\": [\"42.2\", \"-19\", \"7.5\", \"3.14\"] Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. BS An attribute of type Binary Set. For example: \"BS\": [\"U3Vubnk=\", \"Um Fpbnk=\", \"U25vd3k=\"] M An attribute of type Map. For example: \"M\": {\"Name\": {\"S\": \"Joe\"}, \"Age\": {\"N\": \"35\"}} Represents the data for an attribute. L An attribute of type List. For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true. | Return Consumed Capacity: Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput consumption that is returned in the response: INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate Consumed Capacity for the operation, together with Consumed Capacity for each table and secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such as Get Item and Batch Get Item, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying INDEXES will only return Consumed Capacity information for table(s). TOTAL - The response includes only the aggregate Consumed Capacity for the operation. NONE - No Consumed Capacity details are included in the response. | Total Segments: For a parallel Scan request, Total Segments represents the total number of segments into which the Scan operation will be divided. The value of Total Segments corresponds to the number of application workers that will perform the parallel scan. For example, if you want to use four application threads to scan a table or an index, specify a Total Segments value of 4. The value for Total Segments must be greater than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to 1000000. If you specify a Total Segments value of 1, the Scan operation will be sequential rather than parallel. If you specify Total Segments, you must also specify Segment. | Segment: For a parallel Scan request, Segment identifies an individual segment to be scanned by an application worker. Segment I Ds are zero-based, so the first segment is always 0. For example, if you want to use four application threads to scan a table or an index, then the first thread specifies a Segment value of 0, the second thread specifies 1, and so on. The value of Last Evaluated Key returned from a parallel Scan request must be used as Exclusive Start Key with the same segment ID in a subsequent Scan operation. The value for Segment must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than the value provided for Total Segments. If you provide Segment, you must also provide Total Segments. | Projection Expression: A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the specified table or index. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be separated by commas. If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes will be returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they will not appear in the result. For more information, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Filter Expression: A string that contains conditions that Dynamo DB applies after the Scan operation, but before the data is returned to you. Items that do not satisfy the Filter Expression criteria are not returned. For more information, see Filter Expressions in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Expression Attribute Names: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using Expression Attribute Names: To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a Dynamo DB reserved word. To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression. To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression. Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name: Percentile The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for Expression Attribute Names: {\"#P\":\"Percentile\"} You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example: #P = :val For more information on expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Expression Attribute Values: One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the Product Status attribute was one of the following: Available | Backordered | Discontinued You would first need to specify Expression Attribute Values as follows: { \":avail\":{\"S\":\"Available\"}, \":back\":{\"S\":\"Backordered\"}, \":disc\":{\"S\":\"Discontinued\"} } You could then use these values in an expression, such as this: Product Status IN (:avail, :back, :disc) For more information on expression attribute values, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself. For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. S An attribute of type String. For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, Dynamo DB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations. B An attribute of type Binary. For example: \"B\": \"dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk\" SS An attribute of type String Set. For example: \"SS\": [\"Giraffe\", \"Hippo\" ,\"Zebra\"] NS An attribute of type Number Set. For example: \"NS\": [\"42.2\", \"-19\", \"7.5\", \"3.14\"] Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. BS An attribute of type Binary Set. For example: \"BS\": [\"U3Vubnk=\", \"Um Fpbnk=\", \"U25vd3k=\"] M An attribute of type Map. For example: \"M\": {\"Name\": {\"S\": \"Joe\"}, \"Age\": {\"N\": \"35\"}} Represents the data for an attribute. L An attribute of type List. For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true. | Consistent Read: A Boolean value that determines the read consistency model during the scan: If Consistent Read is false, then the data returned from Scan might not contain the results from other recently completed write operations ( Put Item, Update Item, or Delete Item). If Consistent Read is true, then all of the write operations that completed before the Scan began are guaranteed to be contained in the Scan response. The default setting for Consistent Read is false. The Consistent Read parameter is not supported on global secondary indexes. If you scan a global secondary index with Consistent Read set to true, you will receive a Validation Exception.",
    "with_service_params_returns": "Service: Dynamo DB. A low-level client representing Amazon Dynamo DB Amazon Dynamo DB is a fully managed No SQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. Dynamo DB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling. With Dynamo DB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic.

All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SS Ds) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability. Method: scan. The Scan operation returns one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item in a table or a secondary index. To have Dynamo DB return fewer items, you can provide a Filter Expression operation. If the total size of scanned items exceeds the maximum dataset size limit of 1 MB, the scan completes and results are returned to the user. The Last Evaluated Key value is also returned and the requestor can use the Last Evaluated Key to continue the scan in a subsequent operation. Each scan response also includes number of items that were scanned (Scanned Count) as part of the request. If using a Filter Expression, a scan result can result in no items meeting the criteria and the Count will result in zero. If you did not use a Filter Expression in the scan request, then Count is the same as Scanned Count. A single Scan operation first reads up to the maximum number of items set (if using the Limit parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then applies any filtering to the results if a Filter Expression is provided. If Last Evaluated Key is present in the response, pagination is required to complete the full table scan. For more information, see Paginating the Results in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Scan operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster performance on a large table or secondary index, applications can request a parallel Scan operation by providing the Segment and Total Segments parameters. For more information, see Parallel Scan in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. By default, a Scan uses eventually consistent reads when accessing the items in a table. Therefore, the results from an eventually consistent Scan may not include the latest item changes at the time the scan iterates through each item in the table. If you require a strongly consistent read of each item as the scan iterates through the items in the table, you can set the Consistent Read parameter to true. Strong consistency only relates to the consistency of the read at the item level. Parameters: Table Name: The name of the table containing the requested items or if you provide Index Name, the name of the table to which that index belongs. You can also provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter. | Index Name | Attributes To Get: This is a legacy parameter. Use Projection Expression instead. For more information, see Attributes To Get in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Limit | Select: The attributes to be returned in the result. You can retrieve all item attributes, specific item attributes, the count of matching items, or in the case of an index, some or all of the attributes projected into the index. ALL_ATTRIBUTES - Returns all of the item attributes from the specified table or index. If you query a local secondary index, then for each matching item in the index, Dynamo DB fetches the entire item from the parent table. If the index is configured to project all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required. ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES - Allowed only when querying an index. Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the index. If the index is configured to project all attributes, this return value is equivalent to specifying ALL_ATTRIBUTES. COUNT - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the matching items themselves. Note that this uses the same quantity of read capacity units as getting the items, and is subject to the same item size calculations. SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES - Returns only the attributes listed in Projection Expression. This return value is equivalent to specifying Projection Expression without specifying any value for Select. If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected into that index, the operation reads only the index and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, Dynamo DB fetches each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency. If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent table. If neither Select nor Projection Expression are specified, Dynamo DB defaults to ALL_ATTRIBUTES when accessing a table, and ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES when accessing an index. You cannot use both Select and Projection Expression together in a single request, unless the value for Select is SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. (This usage is equivalent to specifying Projection Expression without any value for Select.) | Scan Filter: This is a legacy parameter. Use Filter Expression instead. For more information, see Scan Filter in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents the selection criteria for a Query or Scan operation: For a Query operation, Condition is used for specifying the Key Conditions to use when querying a table or an index. For Key Conditions, only the following comparison operators are supported: EQ | LE | LT | GE | GT | BEGINS_WITH | BETWEEN Condition is also used in a Query Filter, which evaluates the query results and returns only the desired values. For a Scan operation, Condition is used in a Scan Filter, which evaluates the scan results and returns only the desired values. Attribute Value List One or more values to evaluate against the supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the Comparison Operator being used. For type Number, value comparisons are numeric. String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a is greater than A, and a is greater than B. For a list of code values, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters.

For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, Dynamo DB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations. B An attribute of type Binary. For example: \"B\": \"dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk\" SS An attribute of type String Set. For example: \"SS\": [\"Giraffe\", \"Hippo\" ,\"Zebra\"] NS An attribute of type Number Set. For example: \"NS\": [\"42.2\", \"-19\", \"7.5\", \"3.14\"] Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. BS An attribute of type Binary Set. For example: \"BS\": [\"U3Vubnk=\", \"Um Fpbnk=\", \"U25vd3k=\"] M An attribute of type Map. For example: \"M\": {\"Name\": {\"S\": \"Joe\"}, \"Age\": {\"N\": \"35\"}} Represents the data for an attribute. L An attribute of type List. For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true A comparator for evaluating attributes. For example, equals, greater than, less than, etc. The following comparison operators are available: EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN The following are descriptions of each comparison operator. EQ : Equal. EQ is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an Attribute Value element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {\"S\":\"6\"} does not equal {\"N\":\"6\"}. Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not equal {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}. NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an Attribute Value of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. LE : Less than or equal. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}. LT : Less than. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). GE : Greater than or equal. GT : Greater than. NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. NULL : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. CONTAINS : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (' SS', ' NS', or ' BS'), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating ' a CONTAINS b', ' a' can be a list; however, ' b' cannot be a set, a map, or a list.

Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). IN : Checks for matching elements in a list. Attribute Value List can contain one or more Attribute Value elements of type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes are compared against an existing attribute of an item. If any elements of the input are equal to the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true. BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. Attribute Value List must contain two Attribute Value elements of the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second element. For example, {\"S\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"N\":\"6\"}. Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]} For usage examples of Attribute Value List and Comparison Operator, see Legacy Conditional Parameters in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Conditional Operator | Exclusive Start Key: The primary key of the first item that this operation will evaluate. Use the value that was returned for Last Evaluated Key in the previous operation. The data type for Exclusive Start Key must be String, Number or Binary. No set data types are allowed. In a parallel scan, a Scan request that includes Exclusive Start Key must specify the same segment whose previous Scan returned the corresponding value of Last Evaluated Key. Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself. For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. S An attribute of type String. For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, Dynamo DB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations. B An attribute of type Binary. For example: \"B\": \"dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk\" SS An attribute of type String Set. For example: \"SS\": [\"Giraffe\", \"Hippo\" ,\"Zebra\"] NS An attribute of type Number Set. For example: \"NS\": [\"42.2\", \"-19\", \"7.5\", \"3.14\"] Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. BS An attribute of type Binary Set. For example: \"BS\": [\"U3Vubnk=\", \"Um Fpbnk=\", \"U25vd3k=\"] M An attribute of type Map. For example: \"M\": {\"Name\": {\"S\": \"Joe\"}, \"Age\": {\"N\": \"35\"}} Represents the data for an attribute. L An attribute of type List. For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true. | Return Consumed Capacity: Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput consumption that is returned in the response: INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate Consumed Capacity for the operation, together with Consumed Capacity for each table and secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such as Get Item and Batch Get Item, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying INDEXES will only return Consumed Capacity information for table(s). TOTAL - The response includes only the aggregate Consumed Capacity for the operation. NONE - No Consumed Capacity details are included in the response. | Total Segments: For a parallel Scan request, Total Segments represents the total number of segments into which the Scan operation will be divided. The value of Total Segments corresponds to the number of application workers that will perform the parallel scan. For example, if you want to use four application threads to scan a table or an index, specify a Total Segments value of 4. The value for Total Segments must be greater than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to 1000000. If you specify a Total Segments value of 1, the Scan operation will be sequential rather than parallel. If you specify Total Segments, you must also specify Segment. | Segment: For a parallel Scan request, Segment identifies an individual segment to be scanned by an application worker. Segment I Ds are zero-based, so the first segment is always 0. For example, if you want to use four application threads to scan a table or an index, then the first thread specifies a Segment value of 0, the second thread specifies 1, and so on. The value of Last Evaluated Key returned from a parallel Scan request must be used as Exclusive Start Key with the same segment ID in a subsequent Scan operation. The value for Segment must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than the value provided for Total Segments. If you provide Segment, you must also provide Total Segments. | Projection Expression: A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the specified table or index. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be separated by commas. If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes will be returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they will not appear in the result. For more information, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Filter Expression: A string that contains conditions that Dynamo DB applies after the Scan operation, but before the data is returned to you. Items that do not satisfy the Filter Expression criteria are not returned. For more information, see Filter Expressions in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Expression Attribute Names: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using Expression Attribute Names: To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a Dynamo DB reserved word. To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression. To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression. Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name: Percentile The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for Expression Attribute Names: {\"#P\":\"Percentile\"} You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example: #P = :val For more information on expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Expression Attribute Values: One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the Product Status attribute was one of the following: Available | Backordered | Discontinued You would first need to specify Expression Attribute Values as follows: { \":avail\":{\"S\":\"Available\"}, \":back\":{\"S\":\"Backordered\"}, \":disc\":{\"S\":\"Discontinued\"} } You could then use these values in an expression, such as this: Product Status IN (:avail, :back, :disc) For more information on expression attribute values, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself. For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. S An attribute of type String. For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, Dynamo DB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations. B An attribute of type Binary. For example: \"B\": \"dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk\" SS An attribute of type String Set. For example: \"SS\": [\"Giraffe\", \"Hippo\" ,\"Zebra\"] NS An attribute of type Number Set. For example: \"NS\": [\"42.2\", \"-19\", \"7.5\", \"3.14\"] Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. BS An attribute of type Binary Set. For example: \"BS\": [\"U3Vubnk=\", \"Um Fpbnk=\", \"U25vd3k=\"] M An attribute of type Map. For example: \"M\": {\"Name\": {\"S\": \"Joe\"}, \"Age\": {\"N\": \"35\"}} Represents the data for an attribute. L An attribute of type List. For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true. | Consistent Read: A Boolean value that determines the read consistency model during the scan: If Consistent Read is false, then the data returned from Scan might not contain the results from other recently completed write operations ( Put Item, Update Item, or Delete Item). If Consistent Read is true, then all of the write operations that completed before the Scan began are guaranteed to be contained in the Scan response. The default setting for Consistent Read is false. The Consistent Read parameter is not supported on global secondary indexes. If you scan a global secondary index with Consistent Read set to true, you will receive a Validation Exception. Returns: Items: An array of item attributes that match the scan criteria. Each element in this array consists of an attribute name and the value for that attribute. | Count: The number of items in the response. | Scanned Count: The number of items evaluated, before any Scan Filter is applied. A high Scanned Count value with few, or no, Count results indicates an inefficient Scan operation. For more information, see Count and Scanned Count in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Last Evaluated Key: The primary key of the item where the operation stopped, inclusive of the previous result set. Use this value to start a new operation, excluding this value in the new request. | Consumed Capacity: The capacity units consumed by the Scan operation. The data returned includes the total provisioned throughput consumed, along with statistics for the table and any indexes involved in the operation. Consumed Capacity is only returned if the Return Consumed Capacity parameter was specified. For more information, see Capacity unit consumption for read operations in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide."
