    "with_service_params": "Service: Dynamo DB. A low-level client representing Amazon Dynamo DB Amazon Dynamo DB is a fully managed No SQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. Dynamo DB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling. With Dynamo DB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics. Dynamo DB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SS Ds) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability. Method: update table. Modifies the provisioned throughput settings, global secondary indexes, or Dynamo DB Streams settings for a given table. You can only perform one of the following operations at once: Update Table is an asynchronous operation; while it's executing, the table status changes from ACTIVE to UPDATING. While it's UPDATING, you can't issue another Update Table request. When the table returns to the ACTIVE state, the Update Table operation is complete. Parameters: Attribute Definitions: An array of attributes that describe the key schema for the table and indexes. If you are adding a new global secondary index to the table, Attribute Definitions must include the key element(s) of the new index. Represents an attribute for describing the schema for the table and indexes. A name for the attribute. The data type for the attribute, where: S - the attribute is of type String N - the attribute is of type Number B - the attribute is of type Binary. | Table Name: The name of the table to be updated. You can also provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter. | Billing Mode: Controls how you are charged for read and write throughput and how you manage capacity. When switching from pay-per-request to provisioned capacity, initial provisioned capacity values must be set. The initial provisioned capacity values are estimated based on the consumed read and write capacity of your table and global secondary indexes over the past 30 minutes. PAY_PER_REQUEST - We recommend using PAY_PER_REQUEST for most Dynamo DB workloads. PAY_PER_REQUEST sets the billing mode to On-demand capacity mode. PROVISIONED - We recommend using PROVISIONED for steady workloads with predictable growth where capacity requirements can be reliably forecasted. PROVISIONED sets the billing mode to Provisioned capacity mode. | Provisioned Throughput: The new provisioned throughput settings for the specified table or index. The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per second before Dynamo DB returns a Throttling Exception. For more information, see Specifying Read and Write Requirements in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. If read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the value is set to 0. The maximum number of writes consumed per second before Dynamo DB returns a Throttling Exception. If read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the value is set to 0. | Global Secondary Index Updates: An array of one or more global secondary indexes for the table. For each index in the array, you can request one action: Create - add a new global secondary index to the table. Update - modify the provisioned throughput settings of an existing global secondary index. Delete - remove a global secondary index from the table. You can create or delete only one global secondary index per Update Table operation. For more information, see Managing Global Secondary Indexes in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents one of the following: A new global secondary index to be added to an existing table. New provisioned throughput parameters for an existing global secondary index. An existing global secondary index to be removed from an existing table. Update The name of an existing global secondary index, along with new provisioned throughput settings to be applied to that index. The name of the global secondary index to be updated. Provisioned Throughput Represents the provisioned throughput settings for the specified global secondary index. For current minimum and maximum provisioned throughput values, see Service, Account, and Table Quotas in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide.

On Demand Throughput Updates the maximum number of read and write units for the specified global secondary index. If you use this parameter, you must specify Max Read Request Units, Max Write Request Units, or both. Max Read Request Units Maximum number of read request units for the specified table. To specify a maximum On Demand Throughput on your table, set the value of Max Read Request Units as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum On Demand Throughput that is currently set on your table, set the value of Max Read Request Units to -1. Max Write Request Units Maximum number of write request units for the specified table. To specify a maximum On Demand Throughput on your table, set the value of Max Write Request Units as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum On Demand Throughput that is currently set on your table, set the value of Max Write Request Units to -1.

Create The parameters required for creating a global secondary index on an existing table: Index Name Key Schema Attribute Definitions Projection Provisioned Throughput The name of the global secondary index to be created. The key schema for the global secondary index. Represents a single element of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index. A Key Schema Element represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one Key Schema Element (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one Key Schema Element for the partition key, and another Key Schema Element for the sort key. A Key Schema Element must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map. The name of a key attribute. The role that this key attribute will assume: HASH - partition key RANGE - sort key Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into an index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected. Projection Type The set of attributes that are projected into the index: KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index. INCLUDE - In addition to the attributes described in KEYS_ONLY, the secondary index will include other non-key attributes that you specify. ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into the index. When using the Dynamo DB console, ALL is selected by default. Non Key Attributes Represents the non-key attribute names which will be projected into the index. For global and local secondary indexes, the total count of Non Key Attributes summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total. This limit only applies when you specify the Projection Type of INCLUDE. You still can specify the Projection Type of ALL to project all attributes from the source table, even if the table has more than 100 attributes. Provisioned Throughput Represents the provisioned throughput settings for the specified global secondary index.
