    "with_service_params": "Service: Dynamo DB. A low-level client representing Amazon Dynamo DB Amazon Dynamo DB is a fully managed No SQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. Dynamo DB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling. With Dynamo DB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics. Dynamo DB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SS Ds) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability. Method: put item. Creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item. If an item that has the same primary key as the new item already exists in the specified table, the new item completely replaces the existing item. You can perform a conditional put operation (add a new item if one with the specified primary key doesn't exist), or replace an existing item if it has certain attribute values. You can return the item's attribute values in the same operation, using the Return Values parameter. When you add an item, the primary key attributes are the only required attributes. Empty String and Binary attribute values are allowed. Attribute values of type String and Binary must have a length greater than zero if the attribute is used as a key attribute for a table or index. Set type attributes cannot be empty. Invalid Requests with empty values will be rejected with a Validation Exception exception. For more information about Put Item, see Working with Items in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Parameters: Table Name: The name of the table to contain the item. You can also provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter. | Item: A map of attribute name/value pairs, one for each attribute. Only the primary key attributes are required; you can optionally provide other attribute name-value pairs for the item. You must provide all of the attributes for the primary key. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide both values for both the partition key and the sort key. If you specify any attributes that are part of an index key, then the data types for those attributes must match those of the schema in the table's attribute definition. Empty String and Binary attribute values are allowed. Attribute values of type String and Binary must have a length greater than zero if the attribute is used as a key attribute for a table or index. For more information about primary keys, see Primary Key in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Each element in the Item map is an Attribute Value object. Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself. For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. S An attribute of type String. For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, Dynamo DB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations. B An attribute of type Binary. For example: \"B\": \"dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk\" SS An attribute of type String Set. For example: \"SS\": [\"Giraffe\", \"Hippo\" ,\"Zebra\"] NS An attribute of type Number Set. For example: \"NS\": [\"42.2\", \"-19\", \"7.5\", \"3.14\"] Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. BS An attribute of type Binary Set. For example: \"BS\": [\"U3Vubnk=\", \"Um Fpbnk=\", \"U25vd3k=\"] M An attribute of type Map. For example: \"M\": {\"Name\": {\"S\": \"Joe\"}, \"Age\": {\"N\": \"35\"}} Represents the data for an attribute. L An attribute of type List. For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true. | Expected: This is a legacy parameter. Use Condition Expression instead. For more information, see Expected in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents a condition to be compared with an attribute value. This condition can be used with Delete Item, Put Item, or Update Item operations; if the comparison evaluates to true, the operation succeeds; if not, the operation fails. You can use Expected Attribute Value in one of two different ways: Use Attribute Value List to specify one or more values to compare against an attribute. Use Comparison Operator to specify how you want to perform the comparison. If the comparison evaluates to true, then the conditional operation succeeds. Use Value to specify a value that Dynamo DB will compare against an attribute. If the values match, then Expected Attribute Value evaluates to true and the conditional operation succeeds. Optionally, you can also set Exists to false, indicating that you do not expect to find the attribute value in the table. In this case, the conditional operation succeeds only if the comparison evaluates to false. Value and Exists are incompatible with Attribute Value List and Comparison Operator. Note that if you use both sets of parameters at once, Dynamo DB will return a Validation Exception exception. Value Represents the data for the expected attribute. Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself. For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. S An attribute of type String. For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, Dynamo DB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations. B An attribute of type Binary.

For example: \"NS\": [\"42.2\", \"-19\", \"7.5\", \"3.14\"] Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. BS An attribute of type Binary Set. For example: \"BS\": [\"U3Vubnk=\", \"Um Fpbnk=\", \"U25vd3k=\"] M An attribute of type Map. For example: \"M\": {\"Name\": {\"S\": \"Joe\"}, \"Age\": {\"N\": \"35\"}} Represents the data for an attribute. L An attribute of type List. For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true Exists Causes Dynamo DB to evaluate the value before attempting a conditional operation: If Exists is true, Dynamo DB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the operation succeeds. If it is not found, the operation fails with a Condition Check Failed Exception. If Exists is false, Dynamo DB assumes that the attribute value does not exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the operation succeeds. If the value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the operation fails with a Condition Check Failed Exception. The default setting for Exists is true. If you supply a Value all by itself, Dynamo DB assumes the attribute exists: You don't have to set Exists to true, because it is implied. Dynamo DB returns a Validation Exception if: Exists is true but there is no Value to check. (You expect a value to exist, but don't specify what that value is.) Exists is false but you also provide a Value. (You cannot expect an attribute to have a value, while also expecting it not to exist.) Comparison Operator A comparator for evaluating attributes in the Attribute Value List. For example, equals, greater than, less than, etc. The following comparison operators are available: EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN The following are descriptions of each comparison operator. EQ : Equal. EQ is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an Attribute Value element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {\"S\":\"6\"} does not equal {\"N\":\"6\"}. Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not equal {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}. NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an Attribute Value of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. LE : Less than or equal. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}. LT : Less than. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). GE : Greater than or equal. GT : Greater than. NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. NULL : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. CONTAINS : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (' SS', ' NS', or ' BS'), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating ' a CONTAINS b', ' a' can be a list; however, ' b' cannot be a set, a map, or a list. NOT_CONTAINS : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set. If the target attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (' SS', ' NS', or ' BS'), then the operator evaluates to true if it does not find an exact match with any member of the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating ' a NOT CONTAINS b', ' a' can be a list; however, ' b' cannot be a set, a map, or a list. BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix. Attribute Value List can contain only one Attribute Value of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). IN : Checks for matching elements in a list. Attribute Value List can contain one or more Attribute Value elements of type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes are compared against an existing attribute of an item. If any elements of the input are equal to the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true. BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. Attribute Value List must contain two Attribute Value elements of the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second element. For example, {\"S\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"N\":\"6\"}. Also, {\"N\":\"6\"} does not compare to {\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]} Attribute Value List One or more values to evaluate against the supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the Comparison Operator being used. For type Number, value comparisons are numeric. String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a is greater than A, and a is greater than B. For a list of code values, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters. For Binary, Dynamo DB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned when it compares binary values. For information on specifying data types in JSON, see JSON Data Format in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents the data for an attribute. For example: \"BOOL\": true. | Return Values: Use Return Values if you want to get the item attributes as they appeared before they were updated with the Put Item request. For Put Item, the valid values are: NONE - If Return Values is not specified, or if its value is NONE, then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for Return Values.) ALL_OLD - If Put Item overwrote an attribute name-value pair, then the content of the old item is returned. The values returned are strongly consistent. There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed. | Return Consumed Capacity: Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput consumption that is returned in the response: INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate Consumed Capacity for the operation, together with Consumed Capacity for each table and secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such as Get Item and Batch Get Item, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying INDEXES will only return Consumed Capacity information for table(s). TOTAL - The response includes only the aggregate Consumed Capacity for the operation. NONE - No Consumed Capacity details are included in the response. | Return Item Collection Metrics | Conditional Operator | Condition Expression: A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional Put Item operation to succeed. An expression can contain any of the following: Functions: attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | attribute_type | contains | begins_with | size These function names are case-sensitive. Comparison operators: = | <> | < | > | <= | >= | BETWEEN | IN Logical operators: AND | OR | NOT For more information on condition expressions, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Expression Attribute Names: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using Expression Attribute Names: To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a Dynamo DB reserved word. To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression. To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression. Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name: Percentile The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for Expression Attribute Names: {\"#P\":\"Percentile\"} You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example: #P = :val For more information on expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Expression Attribute Values: One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the Product Status attribute was one of the following: Available | Backordered | Discontinued You would first need to specify Expression Attribute Values as follows: { \":avail\":{\"S\":\"Available\"}, \":back\":{\"S\":\"Backordered\"}, \":disc\":{\"S\":\"Discontinued\"} } You could then use these values in an expression, such as this: Product Status IN (:avail, :back, :disc) For more information on expression attribute values, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself. For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. S An attribute of type String. For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries.

For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true. | Return Values On Condition Check Failure: An optional parameter that returns the item attributes for a Put Item operation that failed a condition check. There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.",

TOTAL - The response includes only the aggregate Consumed Capacity for the operation. NONE - No Consumed Capacity details are included in the response. | Return Item Collection Metrics | Conditional Operator | Condition Expression: A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional Put Item operation to succeed. An expression can contain any of the following: Functions: attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | attribute_type | contains | begins_with | size These function names are case-sensitive. Comparison operators: = | <> | < | > | <= | >= | BETWEEN | IN Logical operators: AND | OR | NOT For more information on condition expressions, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Expression Attribute Names: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using Expression Attribute Names: To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a Dynamo DB reserved word. To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression. To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression. Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name: Percentile The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for Expression Attribute Names: {\"#P\":\"Percentile\"} You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example: #P = :val For more information on expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Expression Attribute Values: One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the Product Status attribute was one of the following: Available | Backordered | Discontinued You would first need to specify Expression Attribute Values as follows: { \":avail\":{\"S\":\"Available\"}, \":back\":{\"S\":\"Backordered\"}, \":disc\":{\"S\":\"Discontinued\"} } You could then use these values in an expression, such as this: Product Status IN (:avail, :back, :disc) For more information on expression attribute values, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself. For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. S An attribute of type String. For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, Dynamo DB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations. B An attribute of type Binary. For example: \"B\": \"dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk\" SS An attribute of type String Set. For example: \"SS\": [\"Giraffe\", \"Hippo\" ,\"Zebra\"] NS An attribute of type Number Set. For example: \"NS\": [\"42.2\", \"-19\", \"7.5\", \"3.14\"] Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. BS An attribute of type Binary Set. For example: \"BS\": [\"U3Vubnk=\", \"Um Fpbnk=\", \"U25vd3k=\"] M An attribute of type Map. For example: \"M\": {\"Name\": {\"S\": \"Joe\"}, \"Age\": {\"N\": \"35\"}} Represents the data for an attribute. L An attribute of type List. For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true. | Return Values On Condition Check Failure: An optional parameter that returns the item attributes for a Put Item operation that failed a condition check. There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed. Returns: Attributes: The attribute values as they appeared before the Put Item operation, but only if Return Values is specified as ALL_OLD in the request. Each element consists of an attribute name and an attribute value. | Consumed Capacity: The capacity units consumed by the Put Item operation. The data returned includes the total provisioned throughput consumed, along with statistics for the table and any indexes involved in the operation. Consumed Capacity is only returned if the Return Consumed Capacity parameter was specified. For more information, see Capacity unity consumption for write operations in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. | Item Collection Metrics: Information about item collections, if any, that were affected by the Put Item operation. Item Collection Metrics is only returned if the Return Item Collection Metrics parameter was specified. If the table does not have any local secondary indexes, this information is not returned in the response."
