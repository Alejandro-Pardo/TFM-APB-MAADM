    "method_only": "batch get item. The Batch Get Item operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key. A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. Batch Get Item returns a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, more than 1MB per partition is requested, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for Unprocessed Keys. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to get. For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate Unprocessed Keys value so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset. If none of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then Batch Get Item returns a Provisioned Throughput Exceeded Exception. If at least one of the items is successfully processed, then Batch Get Item completes successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in Unprocessed Keys. By default, Batch Get Item performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set Consistent Read to true for any or all tables. In order to minimize response latency, Batch Get Item may retrieve items in parallel. When designing your application, keep in mind that Dynamo DB does not return items in any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for the items in your request in the Projection Expression parameter. If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read.

    "with_service_params": "Service: Dynamo DB. A low-level client representing Amazon Dynamo DB Amazon Dynamo DB is a fully managed No SQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. Dynamo DB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling. With Dynamo DB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics. Dynamo DB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SS Ds) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability. Method: batch get item. The Batch Get Item operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key. A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items.

If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read. For more information, see Working with Tables in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Parameters: Request Items: A map of one or more table names or table AR Ns and, for each table, a map that describes one or more items to retrieve from that table. Each table name or ARN can be used only once per Batch Get Item request. Each element in the map of items to retrieve consists of the following: Consistent Read - If true, a strongly consistent read is used; if false (the default), an eventually consistent read is used. Expression Attribute Names - One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in the Projection Expression parameter. The following are some use cases for using Expression Attribute Names: To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a Dynamo DB reserved word. To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression. To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression. Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name: Percentile The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for Expression Attribute Names: {\"#P\":\"Percentile\"} You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example: #P = :val For more information about expression attribute names, see Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Keys - An array of primary key attribute values that define specific items in the table. For each primary key, you must provide all of the key attributes. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide the partition key value. For a composite key, you must provide both the partition key value and the sort key value. Projection Expression - A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the table. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be separated by commas. If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes are returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they do not appear in the result. For more information, see Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. Attributes To Get - This is a legacy parameter. Use Projection Expression instead. For more information, see Attributes To Get in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide.

For a composite primary key, you must provide both the partition key and the sort key. The primary key attribute values that define the items and the attributes associated with the items. Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself. For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon Dynamo DB Developer Guide. S An attribute of type String. For example: \"S\": \"Hello\" N An attribute of type Number. For example: \"N\": \"123.45\" Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, Dynamo DB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations. B An attribute of type Binary. For example: \"B\": \"dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk\" SS An attribute of type String Set. For example: \"SS\": [\"Giraffe\", \"Hippo\" ,\"Zebra\"] NS An attribute of type Number Set. For example: \"NS\": [\"42.2\", \"-19\", \"7.5\", \"3.14\"] Numbers are sent across the network to Dynamo DB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. BS An attribute of type Binary Set. For example: \"BS\": [\"U3Vubnk=\", \"Um Fpbnk=\", \"U25vd3k=\"] M An attribute of type Map. For example: \"M\": {\"Name\": {\"S\": \"Joe\"}, \"Age\": {\"N\": \"35\"}} Represents the data for an attribute. L An attribute of type List. For example: \"L\": [ {\"S\": \"Cookies\"} , {\"S\": \"Coffee\"}, {\"N\": \"3.14159\"}] Represents the data for an attribute. NULL An attribute of type Null. For example: \"NULL\": true BOOL An attribute of type Boolean. For example: \"BOOL\": true Attributes To Get This is a legacy parameter.
