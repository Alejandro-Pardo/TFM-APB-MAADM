Parameters: Name: The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that contains the configuration information for the managed node. You can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents you created, or a document that is shared with you from another Amazon Web Services account. For Systems Manager documents (SSM documents) that are shared with you from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format: arn:partition:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name For example: arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For example, AWS-Apply Patch Baseline or My-Document. | Document Version: The document version you want to associate with the targets. Can be a specific version or the default version. | Instance Id: The managed node ID. | Parameters: The parameters for the runtime configuration of the document. | Targets: The targets for the association. You can target managed nodes by using tags, Amazon Web Services resource groups, all managed nodes in an Amazon Web Services account, or individual managed node I Ds. You can target all managed nodes in an Amazon Web Services account by specifying the Instance Ids key with a value of *. For more information about choosing targets for an association, see Understanding targets and rate controls in State Manager associations in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a key-value pair that you specify. Supported formats include the following.

Key User-defined criteria for sending commands that target managed nodes that meet the criteria. Values User-defined criteria that maps to Key. For example, if you specified tag:Server Role, you could specify value:Web Server to run a command on instances that include EC2 tags of Server Role,Web Server. Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50. | Schedule Expression | Output Location: An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket where you want to store the output details of the request. S3Location An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this request. OutputS3Region The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket. OutputS3BucketName The name of the S3 bucket. OutputS3KeyPrefix The S3 bucket subfolder. | Association Name | Automation Target Parameter Name | Max Errors: The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set Max Error to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received. Executions that are already running an association when Max Errors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set Max Concurrency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time. | Max Concurrency: The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same time. If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association while Systems Manager is running Max Concurrency associations, the association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the new managed node will process its association within the limit specified for Max Concurrency. | Compliance Severity | Sync Compliance: The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify AUTO or MANUAL. In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the association is COMPLIANT. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT. In MANUAL mode, you must specify the Association Id as a parameter for the Put Compliance Items API operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the Put Compliance Items API operation. By default, all associations use AUTO mode. | Apply Only At Cron Interval: By default, when you create a new association, the system runs it immediately after it is created and then according to the schedule you specified and when target changes are detected. Specify true for ``Apply Only At Cron Interval``if you want the association to run only according to the schedule you specified. For more information, see Understanding when associations are applied to resources and >About target updates with Automation runbooks in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.

For example, if you specified a cron schedule of cron(0 0 ? * THU#2 *), you could specify an offset of 3 to run the association each Sunday after the second Thursday of the month. For more information about cron schedules for associations, see Reference: Cron and rate expressions for Systems Manager in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. | Duration: The number of hours the association can run before it is canceled. Duration applies to associations that are currently running, and any pending and in progress commands on all targets. If a target was taken offline for the association to run, it is made available again immediately, without a reboot. The Duration parameter applies only when both these conditions are true: The association for which you specify a duration is cancelable according to the parameters of the SSM command document or Automation runbook associated with this execution. The command specifies the Apply Only At Cron Interval parameter, which means that the association doesn't run immediately after it is created, but only according to the specified schedule. | Target Maps: A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both Targets and Target Maps can't be specified together. | Tags: Adds or overwrites one or more tags for a State Manager association. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your Amazon Web Services resources. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Metadata that you assign to your Amazon Web Services resources.
