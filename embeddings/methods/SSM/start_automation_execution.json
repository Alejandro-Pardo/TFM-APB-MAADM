A low-level client representing Amazon Simple Systems Manager (SSM) Amazon Web Services Systems Manager is the operations hub for your Amazon Web Services applications and resources and a secure end-to-end management solution for hybrid cloud environments that enables safe and secure operations at scale. This reference is intended to be used with the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. To get started, see Setting up Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. For information about each of the tools that comprise Systems Manager, see Using Systems Manager tools in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. For details about predefined runbooks for Automation, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, see the Systems Manager Automation runbook reference .

For information about Incident Manager, a tool in Systems Manager, see the Systems Manager Incident Manager User Guide and the Systems Manager Incident Manager API Reference . Method: start automation execution. Initiates execution of an Automation runbook. Parameters: Document Name: The name of the SSM document to run. This can be a public document or a custom document. To run a shared document belonging to another account, specify the document ARN. For more information about how to use shared documents, see Sharing SSM documents in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. | Document Version | Parameters: A key-value map of execution parameters, which match the declared parameters in the Automation runbook. | Client Token | Mode | Target Parameter Name | Targets: A key-value mapping to target resources. Required if you specify Target Parameter Name. If both this parameter and the Target Location:Targets parameter are supplied, Target Location:Targets takes precedence. An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a key-value pair that you specify. Supported formats include the following. Key=tag-key,Values=tag-value-1,tag-value-2 Key=tag:tag-key,Values=tag-value Key=Resource Group,Values=resource-group-name Key=Parameter Values,Values=value-1,value-2,value-3 To target all instances in the Amazon Web Services Region: Key=AWS::EC2::Instance,Values=* Key=Instance Ids,Values=* Key=Instance Ids,Values=instance-id-1,instance-id-2,instance-id-3 Key=tag:tag-key,Values=tag-value-1,tag-value-2 Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=resource-group-name Additionally, Maintenance Windows support targeting resource types: Key=resource-groups:Resource Type Filters,Values=resource-type-1,resource-type-2 Key=Instance Ids,Values=instance-id-1,instance-id-2,instance-id-3 Key=tag:tag-key,Values=tag-value-1,tag-value-2 To target all instances in the Amazon Web Services Region: Key=Instance Ids,Values=* For more information about how to send commands that target managed nodes using Key,Value parameters, see Targeting multiple managed nodes in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. Key User-defined criteria for sending commands that target managed nodes that meet the criteria. Values User-defined criteria that maps to Key. For example, if you specified tag:Server Role, you could specify value:Web Server to run a command on instances that include EC2 tags of Server Role,Web Server. Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50. | Target Maps: A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both Targets and Target Maps can't be specified together. | Max Concurrency: The maximum number of targets allowed to run this task in parallel. You can specify a number, such as 10, or a percentage, such as 10%. The default value is 10. If both this parameter and the Target Location:Targets Max Concurrency are supplied, Target Location:Targets Max Concurrency takes precedence. | Max Errors: The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops running the automation on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops running the automation when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops running the automation on additional targets after the first error result is returned. If you run an automation on 50 resources and set max-errors to 10%, then the system stops running the automation on additional targets when the sixth error is received. Executions that are already running an automation when max-errors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set max-concurrency to 1 so the executions proceed one at a time. If this parameter and the Target Location:Targets Max Errors parameter are both supplied, Target Location:Targets Max Errors takes precedence. | Target Locations: A location is a combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and/or Amazon Web Services accounts where you want to run the automation. Use this operation to start an automation in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions and multiple Amazon Web Services accounts. For more information, see Running automations in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions and accounts in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. The combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web Services accounts targeted by the current Automation execution. Accounts The Amazon Web Services accounts targeted by the current Automation execution. Regions The Amazon Web Services Regions targeted by the current Automation execution.

Target Location Max Errors The maximum number of errors allowed before the system stops queueing additional Automation executions for the currently running Automation. Execution Role Name The Automation execution role used by the currently running Automation. If not specified, the default value is AWS-Systems Manager-Automation Execution Role. Target Location Alarm Configuration The details for the Cloud Watch alarm you want to apply to an automation or command. Ignore Poll Alarm Failure When this value is true, your automation or command continues to run in cases where we can't retrieve alarm status information from Cloud Watch. In cases where we successfully retrieve an alarm status of OK or INSUFFICIENT_DATA, the automation or command continues to run, regardless of this value. Default is false. The name of the Cloud Watch alarm specified in the configuration. A Cloud Watch alarm you apply to an automation or command. The name of your Cloud Watch alarm. Include Child Organization Units Indicates whether to include child organizational units (O Us) that are children of the targeted O Us. The default is false. Exclude Accounts Amazon Web Services accounts or organizational units to exclude as expanded targets. Targets A list of key-value mappings to target resources. If you specify values for this data type, you must also specify a value for Target Parameter Name. This Targets parameter takes precedence over the Start Automation Execution:Targets parameter if both are supplied. An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a key-value pair that you specify. Supported formats include the following.

Targets Max Errors The maximum number of errors that are allowed before the system stops running the automation on additional targets. This Targets Max Errors parameter takes precedence over the Start Automation Execution:Max Errors parameter if both are supplied. | Tags: Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. You can specify a maximum of five tags for an automation. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag an automation to identify an environment or operating system. In this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs: Key=environment,Value=test Key=OS,Value=Windows Metadata that you assign to your Amazon Web Services resources. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. In Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, you can apply tags to Systems Manager documents (SSM documents), managed nodes, maintenance windows, parameters, patch baselines, Ops Items, and Ops Metadata. The name of the tag. The value of the tag. | Alarm Configuration: The Cloud Watch alarm you want to apply to your automation. Ignore Poll Alarm Failure When this value is true, your automation or command continues to run in cases where we can't retrieve alarm status information from Cloud Watch.
