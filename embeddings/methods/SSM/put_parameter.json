A low-level client representing Amazon Simple Systems Manager (SSM) Amazon Web Services Systems Manager is the operations hub for your Amazon Web Services applications and resources and a secure end-to-end management solution for hybrid cloud environments that enables safe and secure operations at scale. This reference is intended to be used with the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. To get started, see Setting up Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. For information about each of the tools that comprise Systems Manager, see Using Systems Manager tools in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. For details about predefined runbooks for Automation, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, see the Systems Manager Automation runbook reference . For information about App Config, a tool in Systems Manager, see the App Config User Guide and the App Config API Reference . For information about Incident Manager, a tool in Systems Manager, see the Systems Manager Incident Manager User Guide and the Systems Manager Incident Manager API Reference . Method: put parameter. Create or update a parameter in Parameter Store. Parameters: Name: The fully qualified name of the parameter that you want to create or update. The fully qualified name includes the complete hierarchy of the parameter path and name. For parameters in a hierarchy, you must include a leading forward slash character (/) when you create or reference a parameter. For example: /Dev/DB Server/My SQL/db-string13 Naming Constraints: Parameter names are case sensitive. A parameter name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region A parameter name can't be prefixed with ' aws' or ' ssm' (case-insensitive). Parameter names can include only the following symbols and letters: a-zA-Z0-9_.- In addition, the slash character ( / ) is used to delineate hierarchies in parameter names. For example: /Dev/Production/East/Project-ABC/My Parameter A parameter name can't include spaces. Parameter hierarchies are limited to a maximum depth of fifteen levels. For additional information about valid values for parameter names, see Creating Systems Manager parameters in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. | Description: Information about the parameter that you want to add to the system. Optional but recommended. | Value: The parameter value that you want to add to the system. Standard parameters have a value limit of 4 KB. Advanced parameters have a value limit of 8 KB. | Type: The type of parameter that you want to create. Items in a String List must be separated by a comma (,). You can't use other punctuation or special character to escape items in the list. If you have a parameter value that requires a comma, then use the String data type. | Key Id: The Key Management Service (KMS) ID that you want to use to encrypt a parameter. Use a custom key for better security. Required for parameters that use the Secure String data type. If you don't specify a key ID, the system uses the default key associated with your Amazon Web Services account, which is not as secure as using a custom key. To use a custom KMS key, choose the Secure String data type with the Key ID parameter. | Overwrite | Allowed Pattern | Tags: Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag a Systems Manager parameter to identify the type of resource to which it applies, the environment, or the type of configuration data referenced by the parameter. In this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs: Key=Resource,Value=S3bucket Key=OS,Value=Windows Key=Parameter Type,Value=License Key Metadata that you assign to your Amazon Web Services resources. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. In Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, you can apply tags to Systems Manager documents (SSM documents), managed nodes, maintenance windows, parameters, patch baselines, Ops Items, and Ops Metadata. The name of the tag. The value of the tag. | Tier: The parameter tier to assign to a parameter. Parameter Store offers a standard tier and an advanced tier for parameters. Standard parameters have a content size limit of 4 KB and can't be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 10,000 standard parameters for each Region in an Amazon Web Services account. Standard parameters are offered at no additional cost. Advanced parameters have a content size limit of 8 KB and can be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 100,000 advanced parameters for each Region in an Amazon Web Services account. Advanced parameters incur a charge. For more information, see Managing parameter tiers in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. You can change a standard parameter to an advanced parameter any time. But you can't revert an advanced parameter to a standard parameter. Reverting an advanced parameter to a standard parameter would result in data loss because the system would truncate the size of the parameter from 8 KB to 4 KB. Reverting would also remove any policies attached to the parameter. Lastly, advanced parameters use a different form of encryption than standard parameters. If you no longer need an advanced parameter, or if you no longer want to incur charges for an advanced parameter, you must delete it and recreate it as a new standard parameter. In Put Parameter requests, you can specify the tier to create the parameter in. Whenever you specify a tier in the request, Parameter Store creates or updates the parameter according to that request. However, if you don't specify a tier in a request, Parameter Store assigns the tier based on the current Parameter Store default tier configuration. The default tier when you begin using Parameter Store is the standard-parameter tier. If you use the advanced-parameter tier, you can specify one of the following as the default: Advanced: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates all requests as advanced parameters. Intelligent-Tiering: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates each request to determine if the parameter is standard or advanced. If the request doesn't include any options that require an advanced parameter, the parameter is created in the standard-parameter tier. If one or more options requiring an advanced parameter are included in the request, Parameter Store create a parameter in the advanced-parameter tier. This approach helps control your parameter-related costs by always creating standard parameters unless an advanced parameter is necessary. Options that require an advanced parameter include the following: The content size of the parameter is more than 4 KB. The parameter uses a parameter policy. More than 10,000 parameters already exist in your Amazon Web Services account in the current Amazon Web Services Region. For more information about configuring the default tier option, see Specifying a default parameter tier in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. | Policies: One or more policies to apply to a parameter. This operation takes a JSON array. Parameter Store, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager supports the following policy types: Expiration: This policy deletes the parameter after it expires. When you create the policy, you specify the expiration date. You can update the expiration date and time by updating the policy. Updating the parameter doesn't affect the expiration date and time. When the expiration time is reached, Parameter Store deletes the parameter. Expiration Notification: This policy initiates an event in Amazon Cloud Watch Events that notifies you about the expiration. By using this policy, you can receive notification before or after the expiration time is reached, in units of days or hours. No Change Notification: This policy initiates a Cloud Watch Events event if a parameter hasn't been modified for a specified period of time. This policy type is useful when, for example, a secret needs to be changed within a period of time, but it hasn't been changed. All existing policies are preserved until you send new policies or an empty policy. For more information about parameter policies, see Assigning parameter policies. | Data Type: The data type for a String parameter. Supported data types include plain text and Amazon Machine Image (AMI) I Ds. text aws:ec2:image aws:ssm:integration When you create a String parameter and specify aws:ec2:image, Amazon Web Services Systems Manager validates the parameter value is in the required format, such as ami-12345abcdeEXAMPLE, and that the specified AMI is available in your Amazon Web Services account.",
