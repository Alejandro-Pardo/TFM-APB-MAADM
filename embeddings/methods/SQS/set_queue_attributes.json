When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system.

    "with_service_params": "Service: SQS. A low-level client representing Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) Welcome to the Amazon SQS API Reference. Amazon SQS is a reliable, highly-scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between applications or microservices. Amazon SQS moves data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these components. For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see Identity and access management in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. You can use Amazon Web Services SD Ks to access Amazon SQS using your favorite programming language. The SD Ks perform tasks such as the following automatically: Cryptographically sign your service requests Retry requests Handle error responses Amazon SQS Product Page Amazon SQS Developer Guide Making API Requests Amazon SQS Message Attributes Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues Amazon SQS in the Command Line Interface Amazon Web Services General Reference Regions and Endpoints. Method: set queue attributes. Sets the value of one or more queue attributes, like a policy. When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the Message Retention Period attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and deleted if the Message Retention Period is reduced below the age of existing messages. Parameters: Queue Url: The URL of the Amazon SQS queue whose attributes are set. Queue UR Ls and names are case-sensitive. | Attributes: A map of attributes to set. The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the Set Queue Attributes action uses: Delay Seconds --- The length of time, in seconds, for which the delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 (15 minutes). Default: 0. Maximum Message Size --- The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 Ki B) up to 262,144 bytes (256 Ki B). Default: 262,144 (256 Ki B). Message Retention Period --- The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer representing seconds, from 60 (1 minute) to 1,209,600 (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days). When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the Message Retention Period attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and deleted if the Message Retention Period is reduced below the age of existing messages. Policy --- The queue's policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy. For more information about policy structure, see Overview of Amazon Web Services IAM Policies in the Identity and Access Management User Guide. Receive Message Wait Time Seconds --- The length of time, in seconds, for which a Receive Message action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Visibility Timeout --- The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. The following attributes apply only to dead-letter queues: Redrive Policy --- The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows: deadLetterTargetArn --- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded. maxReceiveCount --- The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. Default: 10. When the Receive Count for a message exceeds the maxReceiveCount for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue. Redrive Allow Policy --- The string that includes the parameters for the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive permission and which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows: redrivePermission --- The permission type that defines which source queues can specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue. Valid values are: allowAll --- (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web Services account in the same Region can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue. denyAll --- No source queues can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue. byQueue --- Only queues specified by the sourceQueueArns parameter can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue. sourceQueueArns --- The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the source queues that can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue and redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only when the redrivePermission parameter is set to byQueue. You can specify up to 10 source queue AR Ns. To allow more than 10 source queues to specify dead-letter queues, set the redrivePermission parameter to allowAll. The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption: Kms Master Key Id --- The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms. While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always alias/aws/sqs, the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be ``alias/My Alias ``. For more examples, see Key Id in the Key Management Service API Reference. Kms Data Key Reuse Period Seconds --- The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?. Sqs Managed Sse Enabled --- Enables server-side queue encryption using SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option is supported per queue (for example, SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS). The following attribute applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues: Content Based Deduplication --- Enables content-based deduplication. For more information, see Exactly-once processing in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. Note the following: Every message must have a unique Message Deduplication Id. You may provide a Message Deduplication Id explicitly. If you aren't able to provide a Message Deduplication Id and you enable Content Based Deduplication for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the Message Deduplication Id using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message). If you don't provide a Message Deduplication Id and the queue doesn't have Content Based Deduplication set, the action fails with an error. If the queue has Content Based Deduplication set, your Message Deduplication Id overrides the generated one. When Content Based Deduplication is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. If you send one message with Content Based Deduplication enabled and then another message with a Message Deduplication Id that is the same as the one generated for the first Message Deduplication Id, the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered. The following attributes apply only to high throughput for FIFO queues: Deduplication Scope --- Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup and queue. Fifo Throughput Limit --- Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are perQueue and perMessageGroupId. The perMessageGroupId value is allowed only when the value for Deduplication Scope is messageGroup. To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following: Set Deduplication Scope to messageGroup. Set Fifo Throughput Limit to perMessageGroupId. If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified. For information on throughput quotas, see Quotas related to messages in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.",
