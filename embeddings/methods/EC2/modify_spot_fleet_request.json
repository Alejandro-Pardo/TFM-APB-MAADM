You can only use this parameter if you specified a launch template ( Launch Template Configs) in your Spot Fleet request. If you specified Launch Specifications in your Spot Fleet request, then omit this parameter. Describes a launch template and overrides. Launch Template Specification The launch template to use. Make sure that the launch template does not contain the Network Interface Id parameter because you can't specify a network interface ID in a Spot Fleet. Launch Template Id The ID of the launch template. You must specify the Launch Template Id or the Launch Template Name, but not both. Launch Template Name The name of the launch template. You must specify the Launch Template Name or the Launch Template Id, but not both. Version The launch template version number, $Latest, or $Default. You must specify a value, otherwise the request fails. If the value is $Latest, Amazon EC2 uses the latest version of the launch template. If the value is $Default, Amazon EC2 uses the default version of the launch template. Overrides Any parameters that you specify override the same parameters in the launch template. Describes overrides for a launch template. Instance Type The instance type. Spot Price The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance. We do not recommend using this parameter because it can lead to increased interruptions. If you do not specify this parameter, you will pay the current Spot price. Subnet Id The ID of the subnet in which to launch the instances. Availability Zone The Availability Zone in which to launch the instances. Weighted Capacity The number of units provided by the specified instance type. These are the same units that you chose to set the target capacity in terms of instances, or a performance characteristic such as vCPUs, memory, or I/O. If the target capacity divided by this value is not a whole number, Amazon EC2 rounds the number of instances to the next whole number. If this value is not specified, the default is 1. Priority The priority for the launch template override. The highest priority is launched first. If On Demand Allocation Strategy is set to prioritized, Spot Fleet uses priority to determine which launch template override to use first in fulfilling On-Demand capacity. If the Spot Allocation Strategy is set to capacityOptimizedPrioritized, Spot Fleet uses priority on a best-effort basis to determine which launch template override to use in fulfilling Spot capacity, but optimizes for capacity first. Valid values are whole numbers starting at 0. The lower the number, the higher the priority. If no number is set, the launch template override has the lowest priority. You can set the same priority for different launch template overrides. Instance Requirements The instance requirements. When you specify instance requirements, Amazon EC2 will identify instance types with the provided requirements, and then use your On-Demand and Spot allocation strategies to launch instances from these instance types, in the same way as when you specify a list of instance types. V Cpu Count The minimum and maximum number of vCPUs. Min The minimum number of vCPUs. If the value is 0, there is no minimum limit. Max The maximum number of vCPUs.

You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk ( *), to exclude an instance type, size, or generation. The following are examples: m5.8xlarge, c5*.*, m5a.*, r*, *3*. For example, if you specify c5*,Amazon EC2 will exclude the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 will exclude all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: No excluded instance types Instance Generations Indicates whether current or previous generation instance types are included. The current generation instance types are recommended for use. Current generation instance types are typically the latest two to three generations in each instance family. For more information, see Instance types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. For current generation instance types, specify current. For previous generation instance types, specify previous. Default: Current and previous generation instance types Spot Max Price Percentage Over Lowest Price [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified Spot price. The identified Spot price is the Spot price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified Spot price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, and failing that, from the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. When Amazon EC2 selects instance types with your attributes, it will exclude instance types whose Spot price exceeds your specified threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 interprets as a percentage. If you set Target Capacity Unit Type to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is applied based on the per-vCPU or per-memory price instead of the per-instance price. This parameter is not supported for Get Spot Placement Scores and Get Instance Types From Instance Requirements. Default: 100 On Demand Max Price Percentage Over Lowest Price [Price protection] The price protection threshold for On-Demand Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified On-Demand price. The identified On-Demand price is the price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes.

To turn off price protection, specify a high value, such as 999999. Default: 20 Bare Metal Indicates whether bare metal instance types must be included, excluded, or required. To include bare metal instance types, specify included. To require only bare metal instance types, specify required. To exclude bare metal instance types, specify excluded.

Max The maximum amount of network bandwidth, in Gbps. Allowed Instance Types The instance types to apply your specified attributes against. All other instance types are ignored, even if they match your specified attributes. You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk ( *), to allow an instance type, size, or generation. For example, if you specify c5*,Amazon EC2 will allow the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 will allow all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: All instance types Max Spot Price As Percentage Of Optimal On Demand Price [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage of an identified On-Demand price. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, and failing that, from the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. If you set Target Capacity Unit Type to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is based on the per vCPU or per memory price instead of the per instance price. Baseline Performance Factors The baseline performance to consider, using an instance family as a baseline reference. The instance family establishes the lowest acceptable level of performance. Amazon EC2 uses this baseline to guide instance type selection, but there is no guarantee that the selected instance types will always exceed the baseline for every application. Currently, this parameter only supports CPU performance as a baseline performance factor. For more information, see Performance protection in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Cpu The CPU performance to consider, using an instance family as the baseline reference. References Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance.
