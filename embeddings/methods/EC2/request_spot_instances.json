Parameters: Launch Specification: The launch specification. Security Group Ids The I Ds of the security groups. Security Groups Not supported. Addressing Type Deprecated. Block Device Mappings The block device mapping entries. You can't specify both a snapshot ID and an encryption value. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on creation. If a snapshot is the basis for a volume, it is not blank and its encryption status is used for the volume encryption status. Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch. Ebs Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched. Delete On Termination Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Iops The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3, io1, and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting. The following are the supported values for each volume type: gp3: 3,000 - 16,000 IOPS io1: 100 - 64,000 IOPS io2: 100 - 256,000 IOPS For io2 volumes, you can achieve up to 256,000 IOPS on instances built on the Nitro System. On other instances, you can achieve performance up to 32,000 IOPS. This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. Snapshot Id The ID of the snapshot. Volume Size The size of the volume, in Gi Bs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

This parameter is only supported on Block Device Mapping objects called by Run Instances, Request Spot Fleet, and Request Spot Instances. Throughput The throughput that the volume supports, in Mi B/s. This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes. Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000. Outpost Arn The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored. This parameter is not supported when using Create Image. Encrypted Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EBS User Guide. In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume. Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see Supported instance types. This parameter is not returned by Describe Image Attribute. For Create Image and Register Image, whether you can include this parameter, and the allowed values differ depending on the type of block device mapping you are creating. If you are creating a block device mapping for a new (empty) volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true for an encrypted volume, or false for an unencrypted volume. If you omit this parameter, it defaults to false (unencrypted). If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted or unencrypted snapshot, you must omit this parameter. If you include this parameter, the request will fail, regardless of the value that you specify. If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing unencrypted volume, you can include this parameter, but you must specify false. If you specify true, the request will fail. In this case, we recommend that you omit the parameter. If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true or false. However, if you specify false, the parameter is ignored and the block device mapping is always encrypted. No Device To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify an empty string. When this property is specified, the device is removed from the block device mapping regardless of the assigned value. Device Name The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh). Virtual Name The virtual device name ( ephemeral``N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ``ephemeral0 and ephemeral1. The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume. NV Me instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect. Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI. Ebs Optimized Indicates whether the instance is optimized for EBS I/O.

Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with aws:. Value The value of the tag. Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 256 Unicode characters. | Instance Interruption Behavior | Dry Run | Spot Price: The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance. We do not recommend using this parameter because it can lead to increased interruptions. If you do not specify this parameter, you will pay the current Spot price. | Client Token | Instance Count: The maximum number of Spot Instances to launch. Default: 1 | Type: The Spot Instance request type. Default: one-time. | Valid From: The start date of the request. If this is a one-time request, the request becomes active at this date and time and remains active until all instances launch, the request expires, or the request is canceled. If the request is persistent, the request becomes active at this date and time and remains active until it expires or is canceled. The specified start date and time cannot be equal to the current date and time. You must specify a start date and time that occurs after the current date and time. | Valid Until: The end date of the request, in UTC format (YYYY-MM-DD*T*HH:MM:*SS*Z). For a persistent request, the request remains active until the Valid Until date and time is reached. Otherwise, the request remains active until you cancel it. For a one-time request, the request remains active until all instances launch, the request is canceled, or the Valid Until date and time is reached. By default, the request is valid for 7 days from the date the request was created. | Launch Group: The instance launch group. Launch groups are Spot Instances that launch together and terminate together. Default: Instances are launched and terminated individually. | Availability Zone Group: The user-specified name for a logical grouping of requests. When you specify an Availability Zone group in a Spot Instance request, all Spot Instances in the request are launched in the same Availability Zone. Instance proximity is maintained with this parameter, but the choice of Availability Zone is not. The group applies only to requests for Spot Instances of the same instance type. Any additional Spot Instance requests that are specified with the same Availability Zone group name are launched in that same Availability Zone, as long as at least one instance from the group is still active. If there is no active instance running in the Availability Zone group that you specify for a new Spot Instance request (all instances are terminated, the request is expired, or the maximum price you specified falls below current Spot price), then Amazon EC2 launches the instance in any Availability Zone where the constraint can be met. Consequently, the subsequent set of Spot Instances could be placed in a different zone from the original request, even if you specified the same Availability Zone group. Default: Instances are launched in any available Availability Zone. | Block Duration Minutes",
