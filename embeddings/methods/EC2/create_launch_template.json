If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 will allow all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: All instance types Max Spot Price As Percentage Of Optimal On Demand Price [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage of an identified On-Demand price. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, and failing that, from the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. If you set Target Capacity Unit Type to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is based on the per vCPU or per memory price instead of the per instance price. Baseline Performance Factors The baseline performance to consider, using an instance family as a baseline reference. The instance family establishes the lowest acceptable level of performance. Amazon EC2 uses this baseline to guide instance type selection, but there is no guarantee that the selected instance types will always exceed the baseline for every application.

If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 will allow all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: All instance types Max Spot Price As Percentage Of Optimal On Demand Price [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage of an identified On-Demand price. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, and failing that, from the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. If you set Target Capacity Unit Type to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is based on the per vCPU or per memory price instead of the per instance price. Baseline Performance Factors The baseline performance to consider, using an instance family as a baseline reference. The instance family establishes the lowest acceptable level of performance. Amazon EC2 uses this baseline to guide instance type selection, but there is no guarantee that the selected instance types will always exceed the baseline for every application.
