Parameters: Dry Run | Excess Capacity Termination Policy: Indicates whether running instances should be terminated if the total target capacity of the EC2 Fleet is decreased below the current size of the EC2 Fleet. Supported only for fleets of type maintain. | Launch Template Configs: The launch template and overrides. Describes a launch template and overrides. Launch Template Specification The launch template to use. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request. Launch Template Id The ID of the launch template. You must specify the Launch Template Id or the Launch Template Name, but not both. Launch Template Name The name of the launch template. You must specify the Launch Template Name or the Launch Template Id, but not both. Version The launch template version number, $Latest, or $Default. You must specify a value, otherwise the request fails. If the value is $Latest, Amazon EC2 uses the latest version of the launch template. If the value is $Default, Amazon EC2 uses the default version of the launch template. Overrides Any parameters that you specify override the same parameters in the launch template. For fleets of type request and maintain, a maximum of 300 items is allowed across all launch templates. Describes overrides for a launch template. Instance Type The instance type. mac1.metal is not supported as a launch template override. Max Price The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance. We do not recommend using this parameter because it can lead to increased interruptions. If you do not specify this parameter, you will pay the current Spot price. Subnet Id The I Ds of the subnets in which to launch the instances. Separate multiple subnet I Ds using commas (for example, subnet-1234abcdeexample1, subnet-0987cdef6example2). A request of type instant can have only one subnet ID. Availability Zone The Availability Zone in which to launch the instances. Weighted Capacity The number of units provided by the specified instance type. These are the same units that you chose to set the target capacity in terms of instances, or a performance characteristic such as vCPUs, memory, or I/O. If the target capacity divided by this value is not a whole number, Amazon EC2 rounds the number of instances to the next whole number. If this value is not specified, the default is 1. Priority The priority for the launch template override. The highest priority is launched first. If the On-Demand Allocation Strategy is set to prioritized, EC2 Fleet uses priority to determine which launch template override to use first in fulfilling On-Demand capacity. If the Spot Allocation Strategy is set to capacity-optimized-prioritized, EC2 Fleet uses priority on a best-effort basis to determine which launch template override to use in fulfilling Spot capacity, but optimizes for capacity first. Valid values are whole numbers starting at 0. The lower the number, the higher the priority. If no number is set, the launch template override has the lowest priority. You can set the same priority for different launch template overrides. Placement The location where the instance launched, if applicable. Affinity The affinity setting for the instance on the Dedicated Host. This parameter is not supported for Create Fleet or Import Instance. Group Name The name of the placement group that the instance is in. If you specify Group Name, you can't specify Group Id. Partition Number The number of the partition that the instance is in. Valid only if the placement group strategy is set to partition. This parameter is not supported for Create Fleet. Host Id The ID of the Dedicated Host on which the instance resides. Tenancy The tenancy of the instance. An instance with a tenancy of dedicated runs on single-tenant hardware. The host tenancy is not supported for Import Instance or for T3 instances that are configured for the unlimited CPU credit option. Spread Domain Reserved for future use. Host Resource Group Arn The ARN of the host resource group in which to launch the instances. If you specify this parameter, either omit the Tenancy parameter or set it to host. Group Id The ID of the placement group that the instance is in. If you specify Group Id, you can't specify Group Name. Availability Zone The Availability Zone of the instance. If not specified, an Availability Zone will be automatically chosen for you based on the load balancing criteria for the Region. Block Device Mappings The block device mappings, which define the EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to the instance at launch. Supported only for fleets of type instant. For more information, see Block device mappings for volumes on Amazon EC2 instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch. To override a block device mapping specified in the launch template: Specify the exact same Device Name here as specified in the launch template. Only specify the parameters you want to change. Any parameters you don't specify here will keep their original launch template values. To add a new block device mapping: Specify a Device Name that doesn't exist in the launch template. Specify all desired parameters here. Device Name The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh). Virtual Name The virtual device name ( ephemeralN). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1. The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume. NV Me instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect. Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI. Ebs Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched. Encrypted Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EBS User Guide. In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume. Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see Supported instance types. This parameter is not returned by Describe Image Attribute. For Create Image and Register Image, whether you can include this parameter, and the allowed values differ depending on the type of block device mapping you are creating. If you are creating a block device mapping for a new (empty) volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true for an encrypted volume, or false for an unencrypted volume. If you omit this parameter, it defaults to false (unencrypted). If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted or unencrypted snapshot, you must omit this parameter. If you include this parameter, the request will fail, regardless of the value that you specify. If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing unencrypted volume, you can include this parameter, but you must specify false. If you specify true, the request will fail. In this case, we recommend that you omit the parameter. If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true or false. However, if you specify false, the parameter is ignored and the block device mapping is always encrypted. Delete On Termination Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see Preserve data when an instance is terminated in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Iops The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3, io1, and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting. The following are the supported values for each volume type: gp3: 3,000 - 16,000 IOPS io1: 100 - 64,000 IOPS io2: 100 - 256,000 IOPS For io2 volumes, you can achieve up to 256,000 IOPS on instances built on the Nitro System. On other instances, you can achieve performance up to 32,000 IOPS. This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. Throughput The throughput that the volume supports, in Mi B/s. This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes. Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000. Kms Key Id Identifier (key ID, key alias, key ARN, or alias ARN) of the customer managed KMS key to use for EBS encryption. This parameter is only supported on Block Device Mapping objects called by Create Fleet, Request Spot Instances, and Run Instances. Snapshot Id The ID of the snapshot. Volume Size The size of the volume, in Gi Bs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size. The following are the supported sizes for each volume type: gp2 and gp3: 1 - 16,384 Gi B io1: 4 - 16,384 Gi B io2: 4 - 65,536 Gi B st1 and sc1: 125 - 16,384 Gi B standard: 1 - 1024 Gi B Volume Type The volume type.

You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk ( *), to exclude an instance family, type, size, or generation. The following are examples: m5.8xlarge, c5*.*, m5a.*, r*, *3*. For example, if you specify c5*,Amazon EC2 will exclude the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 will exclude all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: No excluded instance types Instance Generations Indicates whether current or previous generation instance types are included. The current generation instance types are recommended for use. Current generation instance types are typically the latest two to three generations in each instance family. For more information, see Instance types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. For current generation instance types, specify current. For previous generation instance types, specify previous. Default: Current and previous generation instance types Spot Max Price Percentage Over Lowest Price [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified Spot price. The identified Spot price is the Spot price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified Spot price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, and failing that, from the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. When Amazon EC2 selects instance types with your attributes, it will exclude instance types whose Spot price exceeds your specified threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 interprets as a percentage. If you set Target Capacity Unit Type to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is applied based on the per-vCPU or per-memory price instead of the per-instance price. This parameter is not supported for Get Spot Placement Scores and Get Instance Types From Instance Requirements. Default: 100 On Demand Max Price Percentage Over Lowest Price [Price protection] The price protection threshold for On-Demand Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified On-Demand price. The identified On-Demand price is the price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes. When Amazon EC2 selects instance types with your attributes, it will exclude instance types whose price exceeds your specified threshold. To indicate no price protection threshold, specify a high value, such as 999999. Default: 20 Bare Metal Indicates whether bare metal instance types must be included, excluded, or required. To include bare metal instance types, specify included. To require only bare metal instance types, specify required. To exclude bare metal instance types, specify excluded.

Max The maximum amount of network bandwidth, in Gbps. Allowed Instance Types The instance types to apply your specified attributes against. All other instance types are ignored, even if they match your specified attributes. You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk ( *), to allow an instance type, size, or generation. For example, if you specify c5*,Amazon EC2 will allow the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 will allow all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: All instance types Max Spot Price As Percentage Of Optimal On Demand Price [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage of an identified On-Demand price. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, and failing that, from the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. If you set Target Capacity Unit Type to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is based on the per vCPU or per memory price instead of the per instance price. Baseline Performance Factors The baseline performance to consider, using an instance family as a baseline reference. The instance family establishes the lowest acceptable level of performance. Amazon EC2 uses this baseline to guide instance type selection, but there is no guarantee that the selected instance types will always exceed the baseline for every application. Currently, this parameter only supports CPU performance as a baseline performance factor. For more information, see Performance protection in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Cpu The CPU performance to consider, using an instance family as the baseline reference. References Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture differences. Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture. Instance Family The instance family to use as a baseline reference. The following instance families are not supported for performance protection: c1 g3 | g3s hpc7g m1 | m2 mac1 | mac2 | mac2-m1ultra | mac2-m2 | mac2-m2pro p3dn | p4d | p5 t1 u-12tb1 | u-18tb1 | u-24tb1 | u-3tb1 | u-6tb1 | u-9tb1 | u7i-12tb | u7in-16tb | u7in-24tb | u7in-32tb If you enable performance protection by specifying a supported instance family, the returned instance types will exclude the above unsupported instance families. If you specify an unsupported instance family as a value for baseline performance, the API returns an empty response for Get Instance Types From Instance Requirements and an exception for Create Fleet, Request Spot Fleet, Modify Fleet, and Modify Spot Fleet Request. Image Id The ID of the AMI in the format ami-17characters00000. Alternatively, you can specify a Systems Manager parameter, using one of the following formats. The Systems Manager parameter will resolve to an AMI ID on launch. To reference a public parameter: resolve:ssm:public-parameter To reference a parameter stored in the same account: resolve:ssm:parameter-name resolve:ssm:parameter-name:version-number resolve:ssm:parameter-name:label To reference a parameter shared from another Amazon Web Services account: resolve:ssm:parameter-ARN resolve:ssm:parameter-ARN:version-number resolve:ssm:parameter-ARN:label For more information, see Use a Systems Manager parameter instead of an AMI ID in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. | Fleet Id: The ID of the EC2 Fleet. | Target Capacity Specification: The size of the EC2 Fleet.

While the EC2 Fleet is being modified, it is in the modifying state. To scale up your EC2 Fleet, increase its target capacity. The EC2 Fleet launches the additional Spot Instances according to the allocation strategy for the EC2 Fleet request. If the allocation strategy is lowest-price, the EC2 Fleet launches instances using the Spot Instance pool with the lowest price. If the allocation strategy is diversified, the EC2 Fleet distributes the instances across the Spot Instance pools. If the allocation strategy is capacity-optimized, EC2 Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching. To scale down your EC2 Fleet, decrease its target capacity. First, the EC2 Fleet cancels any open requests that exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the EC2 Fleet terminate Spot Instances until the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the new target capacity. If the allocation strategy is lowest-price, the EC2 Fleet terminates the instances with the highest price per unit. If the allocation strategy is capacity-optimized, the EC2 Fleet terminates the instances in the Spot Instance pools that have the least available Spot Instance capacity. If the allocation strategy is diversified, the EC2 Fleet terminates instances across the Spot Instance pools. Alternatively, you can request that the EC2 Fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you terminate manually. If you are finished with your EC2 Fleet for now, but will use it again later, you can set the target capacity to 0.

You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk ( *), to exclude an instance family, type, size, or generation. The following are examples: m5.8xlarge, c5*.*, m5a.*, r*, *3*. For example, if you specify c5*,Amazon EC2 will exclude the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 will exclude all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: No excluded instance types Instance Generations Indicates whether current or previous generation instance types are included. The current generation instance types are recommended for use. Current generation instance types are typically the latest two to three generations in each instance family. For more information, see Instance types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. For current generation instance types, specify current. For previous generation instance types, specify previous. Default: Current and previous generation instance types Spot Max Price Percentage Over Lowest Price [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified Spot price. The identified Spot price is the Spot price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified Spot price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, and failing that, from the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. When Amazon EC2 selects instance types with your attributes, it will exclude instance types whose Spot price exceeds your specified threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 interprets as a percentage. If you set Target Capacity Unit Type to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is applied based on the per-vCPU or per-memory price instead of the per-instance price. This parameter is not supported for Get Spot Placement Scores and Get Instance Types From Instance Requirements. Default: 100 On Demand Max Price Percentage Over Lowest Price [Price protection] The price protection threshold for On-Demand Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified On-Demand price. The identified On-Demand price is the price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes. When Amazon EC2 selects instance types with your attributes, it will exclude instance types whose price exceeds your specified threshold. To indicate no price protection threshold, specify a high value, such as 999999. Default: 20 Bare Metal Indicates whether bare metal instance types must be included, excluded, or required. To include bare metal instance types, specify included. To require only bare metal instance types, specify required. To exclude bare metal instance types, specify excluded.

Max The maximum amount of network bandwidth, in Gbps. Allowed Instance Types The instance types to apply your specified attributes against. All other instance types are ignored, even if they match your specified attributes. You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk ( *), to allow an instance type, size, or generation. For example, if you specify c5*,Amazon EC2 will allow the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify m5a.*, Amazon EC2 will allow all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. Default: All instance types Max Spot Price As Percentage Of Optimal On Demand Price [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage of an identified On-Demand price. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, and failing that, from the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. If you set Target Capacity Unit Type to vcpu or memory-mib, the price protection threshold is based on the per vCPU or per memory price instead of the per instance price. Baseline Performance Factors The baseline performance to consider, using an instance family as a baseline reference. The instance family establishes the lowest acceptable level of performance. Amazon EC2 uses this baseline to guide instance type selection, but there is no guarantee that the selected instance types will always exceed the baseline for every application. Currently, this parameter only supports CPU performance as a baseline performance factor. For more information, see Performance protection in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Cpu The CPU performance to consider, using an instance family as the baseline reference. References Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture differences. Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU performance. All instance types that match your specified attributes will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture. Instance Family The instance family to use as a baseline reference. The following instance families are not supported for performance protection: c1 g3 | g3s hpc7g m1 | m2 mac1 | mac2 | mac2-m1ultra | mac2-m2 | mac2-m2pro p3dn | p4d | p5 t1 u-12tb1 | u-18tb1 | u-24tb1 | u-3tb1 | u-6tb1 | u-9tb1 | u7i-12tb | u7in-16tb | u7in-24tb | u7in-32tb If you enable performance protection by specifying a supported instance family, the returned instance types will exclude the above unsupported instance families. If you specify an unsupported instance family as a value for baseline performance, the API returns an empty response for Get Instance Types From Instance Requirements and an exception for Create Fleet, Request Spot Fleet, Modify Fleet, and Modify Spot Fleet Request. Image Id The ID of the AMI in the format ami-17characters00000. Alternatively, you can specify a Systems Manager parameter, using one of the following formats. The Systems Manager parameter will resolve to an AMI ID on launch. To reference a public parameter: resolve:ssm:public-parameter To reference a parameter stored in the same account: resolve:ssm:parameter-name resolve:ssm:parameter-name:version-number resolve:ssm:parameter-name:label To reference a parameter shared from another Amazon Web Services account: resolve:ssm:parameter-ARN resolve:ssm:parameter-ARN:version-number resolve:ssm:parameter-ARN:label For more information, see Use a Systems Manager parameter instead of an AMI ID in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. | Fleet Id: The ID of the EC2 Fleet. | Target Capacity Specification: The size of the EC2 Fleet.
