    "method_only": "register image. Registers an AMI. When you're creating an instance-store backed AMI, registering the AMI is the final step in the creation process. For more information about creating AM Is, see Create an AMI from a snapshot and Create an instance-store backed AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you make to an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its registration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the previous image and register the new image. You can use Register Image to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from a snapshot of a root device volume. You specify the snapshot using a block device mapping. You can't set the encryption state of the volume using the block device mapping. If the snapshot is encrypted, or encryption by default is enabled, the root volume of an instance launched from the AMI is encrypted. For more information, see Create an AMI from a snapshot and Use encryption with Amazon EBS-backed AM Is in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. If any snapshots have Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes, they are copied to the new AMI. In most cases, AM Is for Windows, Red Hat, SUSE, and SQL Server require correct licensing information to be present on the AMI. For more information, see Understand AMI billing information in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. When creating an AMI from a snapshot, the Register Image operation derives the correct billing information from the snapshot's metadata, but this requires the appropriate metadata to be present. To verify if the correct billing information was applied, check the Platform Details field on the new AMI. If the field is empty or doesn't match the expected operating system code (for example, Windows, Red Hat, SUSE, or SQL), the AMI creation was unsuccessful, and you should discard the AMI and instead create the AMI from an instance using Create Image. For more information, see Create an AMI from an instance in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. If you purchase a Reserved Instance to apply to an On-Demand Instance that was launched from an AMI with a billing product code, make sure that the Reserved Instance has the matching billing product code. If you purchase a Reserved Instance without the matching billing product code, the Reserved Instance will not be applied to the On-Demand Instance.

For information about how to obtain the platform details and billing information of an AMI, see Understand AMI billing information in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Parameters: Image Location | Billing Products: The billing product codes. Your account must be authorized to specify billing product codes. If your account is not authorized to specify billing product codes, you can publish AM Is that include billable software and list them on the Amazon Web Services Marketplace. You must first register as a seller on the Amazon Web Services Marketplace. For more information, see Getting started as a seller and AMI-based products in the Amazon Web Services Marketplace Seller Guide. | Boot Mode: The boot mode of the AMI. A value of uefi-preferred indicates that the AMI supports both UEFI and Legacy BIOS. For more information, see Boot modes in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. | Tpm Support | Uefi Data | Imds Support: Set to v2.0 to indicate that IMDSv2 is specified in the AMI. Instances launched from this AMI will have Http Tokens automatically set to required so that, by default, the instance requires that IMDSv2 is used when requesting instance metadata. In addition, Http Put Response Hop Limit is set to 2. For more information, see Configure the AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. | Tag Specifications: The tags to apply to the AMI. To tag the AMI, the value for Resource Type must be image. If you specify another value for Resource Type, the request fails. To tag an AMI after it has been registered, see Create Tags. The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being created. When you specify a tag, you must specify the resource type to tag, otherwise the request will fail. Resource Type The type of resource to tag on creation. Tags The tags to apply to the resource. Describes a tag. Key The key of the tag. Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with aws:. Value The value of the tag. Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 256 Unicode characters. | Dry Run | Name: A name for your AMI. Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, parentheses (()), square brackets ([]), spaces ( ), periods (.), slashes (/), dashes (-), single quotes (--\u0098), at-signs (@), or underscores(_) | Description | Architecture: The architecture of the AMI. Default: For Amazon EBS-backed AM Is, i386. For instance store-backed AM Is, the architecture specified in the manifest file. | Kernel Id | Ramdisk Id | Root Device Name | Block Device Mappings: The block device mapping entries. If you specify an Amazon EBS volume using the ID of an Amazon EBS snapshot, you can't specify the encryption state of the volume. If you create an AMI on an Outpost, then all backing snapshots must be on the same Outpost or in the Region of that Outpost. AM Is on an Outpost that include local snapshots can be used to launch instances on the same Outpost only. For more information, Amazon EBS local snapshots on Outposts in the Amazon EBS User Guide. Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch. Ebs Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched. Delete On Termination Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. Iops The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3, io1, and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting. The following are the supported values for each volume type: gp3: 3,000 - 16,000 IOPS io1: 100 - 64,000 IOPS io2: 100 - 256,000 IOPS For io2 volumes, you can achieve up to 256,000 IOPS on instances built on the Nitro System. On other instances, you can achieve performance up to 32,000 IOPS. This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. Snapshot Id The ID of the snapshot. Volume Size The size of the volume, in Gi Bs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size. The following are the supported sizes for each volume type: gp2 and gp3: 1 - 16,384 Gi B io1: 4 - 16,384 Gi B io2: 4 - 65,536 Gi B st1 and sc1: 125 - 16,384 Gi B standard: 1 - 1024 Gi B Volume Type The volume type. For more information, see Amazon EBS volume types in the Amazon EBS User Guide. Kms Key Id Identifier (key ID, key alias, key ARN, or alias ARN) of the customer managed KMS key to use for EBS encryption. This parameter is only supported on Block Device Mapping objects called by Run Instances, Request Spot Fleet, and Request Spot Instances. Throughput The throughput that the volume supports, in Mi B/s. This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes. Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000. Outpost Arn The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored. This parameter is not supported when using Create Image. Encrypted Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EBS User Guide. In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume. Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see Supported instance types. This parameter is not returned by Describe Image Attribute. For Create Image and Register Image, whether you can include this parameter, and the allowed values differ depending on the type of block device mapping you are creating. If you are creating a block device mapping for a new (empty) volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true for an encrypted volume, or false for an unencrypted volume. If you omit this parameter, it defaults to false (unencrypted). If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted or unencrypted snapshot, you must omit this parameter. If you include this parameter, the request will fail, regardless of the value that you specify. If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing unencrypted volume, you can include this parameter, but you must specify false. If you specify true, the request will fail. In this case, we recommend that you omit the parameter. If you are creating a block device mapping from an existing encrypted volume, you can include this parameter, and specify either true or false. However, if you specify false, the parameter is ignored and the block device mapping is always encrypted. No Device To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify an empty string. When this property is specified, the device is removed from the block device mapping regardless of the assigned value. Device Name The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh). Virtual Name The virtual device name ( ephemeral``N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ``ephemeral0 and ephemeral1. The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume. NV Me instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect. Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI. | Virtualization Type: The type of virtualization ( hvm | paravirtual). Default: paravirtual. | Sriov Net Support: Set to simple to enable enhanced networking with the Intel 82599 Virtual Function interface for the AMI and any instances that you launch from the AMI. There is no way to disable sriovNetSupport at this time. This option is supported only for HVM AM Is. Specifying this option with a PV AMI can make instances launched from the AMI unreachable. | Ena Support: Set to true to enable enhanced networking with ENA for the AMI and any instances that you launch from the AMI. This option is supported only for HVM AM Is. Specifying this option with a PV AMI can make instances launched from the AMI unreachable.",
