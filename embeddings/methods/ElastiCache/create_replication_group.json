You should use Replicas Per Node Group instead. If Automatic Failover Enabled is true, the value of this parameter must be at least 2. If Automatic Failover Enabled is false you can omit this parameter (it will default to 1), or you can explicitly set it to a value between 2 and 6. The maximum permitted value for Num Cache Clusters is 6 (1 primary plus 5 replicas). | Preferred Cache Cluster A Zs: A list of EC2 Availability Zones in which the replication group's clusters are created. The order of the Availability Zones in the list is the order in which clusters are allocated. The primary cluster is created in the first AZ in the list.

Each node group (shard) configuration has the following members: Primary Availability Zone, Replica Availability Zones, Replica Count, and Slots. If you're creating a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) or a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication group, you can use this parameter to individually configure each node group (shard), or you can omit this parameter. However, it is required when seeding a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster from a S3 rdb file. You must configure each node group (shard) using this parameter because you must specify the slots for each node group. Node group (shard) configuration options.

If you want to use an earlier engine version, you must delete the existing cluster or replication group and create it anew with the earlier engine version. | Cache Parameter Group Name: The name of the parameter group to associate with this replication group. If this argument is omitted, the default cache parameter group for the specified engine is used. If you are running Valkey or Redis OSS version 3.2.4 or later, only one node group (shard), and want to use a default parameter group, we recommend that you specify the parameter group by name. To create a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) replication group, use Cache Parameter Group Name=default.redis3.2.

Default true. | Data Tiering Enabled | Network Type | Ip Discovery | Transit Encryption Mode: A setting that allows you to migrate your clients to use in-transit encryption, with no downtime. When setting Transit Encryption Enabled to true, you can set your Transit Encryption Mode to preferred in the same request, to allow both encrypted and unencrypted connections at the same time. Once you migrate all your Valkey or Redis OSS clients to use encrypted connections you can modify the value to required to allow encrypted connections only. Setting Transit Encryption Mode to required is a two-step process that requires you to first set the Transit Encryption Mode to preferred, after that you can set Transit Encryption Mode to required. This process will not trigger the replacement of the replication group. | Cluster Mode | Serverless Cache Snapshot Name",
