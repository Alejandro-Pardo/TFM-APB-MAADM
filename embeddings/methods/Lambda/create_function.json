    "method_only": "create function. Creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a deployment package and an execution role. The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use Amazon Web Services services, such as Amazon Cloud Watch Logs for log streaming and X-Ray for request tracing. If the deployment package is a container image, then you set the package type to Image. For a container image, the code property must include the URI of a container image in the Amazon ECR registry. You do not need to specify the handler and runtime properties. If the deployment package is a .zip file archive, then you set the package type to Zip. For a .zip file archive, the code property specifies the location of the .zip file. You must also specify the handler and runtime properties. The code in the deployment package must be compatible with the target instruction set architecture of the function ( x86-64 or arm64). If you do not specify the architecture, then the default value is x86-64. When you create a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a minute or so. During this time, you can't invoke or modify the function. The State, State Reason, and State Reason Code fields in the response from Get Function Configuration indicate when the function is ready to invoke. For more information, see Lambda function states. A function has an unpublished version, and can have published versions and aliases. The unpublished version changes when you update your function's code and configuration. A published version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can be changed to map to a different version. Use the Publish parameter to create version 1 of your function from its initial configuration. The other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings. You can modify version-specific settings later with Update Function Configuration. Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the function, and include tags ( Tag Resource) and per-function concurrency limits ( Put Function Concurrency). You can use code signing if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to deploy a code package with Update Function Code, Lambda checks that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing configuration includes set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function. If another Amazon Web Services account or an Amazon Web Services service invokes your function, use Add Permission to grant permission by creating a resource-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. You can grant permissions at the function level, on a version, or on an alias. To invoke your function directly, use Invoke. To invoke your function in response to events in other Amazon Web Services services, create an event source mapping ( Create Event Source Mapping), or configure a function trigger in the other service. For more information, see Invoking Lambda functions.",
    "with_service_params": "Service: Lambda. A low-level client representing AWS Lambda Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. For more information about the Lambda service, see What is Lambda in the Lambda Developer Guide. The Lambda API Reference provides information about each of the API methods, including details about the parameters in each API request and response. You can use Software Development Kits (SD Ks), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools to access the API. For installation instructions, see Tools for Amazon Web Services. For a list of Region-specific endpoints that Lambda supports, see Lambda endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.. When making the API calls, you will need to authenticate your request by providing a signature. Lambda supports signature version 4. For more information, see Signature Version 4 signing process in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.. Because Amazon Web Services SD Ks use the CA certificates from your computer, changes to the certificates on the Amazon Web Services servers can cause connection failures when you attempt to use an SDK. You can prevent these failures by keeping your computer's CA certificates and operating system up-to-date. If you encounter this issue in a corporate environment and do not manage your own computer, you might need to ask an administrator to assist with the update process. The following list shows minimum operating system and Java versions: Microsoft Windows versions that have updates from January 2005 or later installed contain at least one of the required C As in their trust list. Mac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 5 (February 2007), Mac OS X 10.5 (October 2007), and later versions contain at least one of the required C As in their trust list. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), 6, and 7 and Cent OS 5, 6, and 7 all contain at least one of the required C As in their default trusted CA list. Java 1.4.2_12 (May 2006), 5 Update 2 (March 2005), and all later versions, including Java 6 (December 2006), 7, and 8, contain at least one of the required C As in their default trusted CA list. When accessing the Lambda management console or Lambda API endpoints, whether through browsers or programmatically, you will need to ensure your client machines support any of the following C As: Amazon Root CA 1 Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority - G2 Starfield Class 2 Certification Authority Root certificates from the first two authorities are available from Amazon trust services, but keeping your computer up-to-date is the more straightforward solution.

For more information, see Invoking Lambda functions. Parameters: Function Name: The name or ARN of the Lambda function. Function name --- my-function. Function ARN --- arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function. Partial ARN --- 123456789012:function:my-function. The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length. | Runtime: The identifier of the function's runtime. Runtime is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive. Specifying a runtime results in an error if you're deploying a function using a container image. The following list includes deprecated runtimes. Lambda blocks creating new functions and updating existing functions shortly after each runtime is deprecated. For more information, see Runtime use after deprecation. For a list of all currently supported runtimes, see Supported runtimes. | Role: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function's execution role. | Handler | Code: The code for the function.

For more information, see Specifying a customer managed key for Lambda. The optimized version of the container image that's used for function invocations. Note that this is not the same key that's used to protect your container image in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). For more information, see Function lifecycle. If you don't provide a customer managed key, Lambda uses an Amazon Web Services owned key or an Amazon Web Services managed key. | Tracing Config: Set Mode to Active to sample and trace a subset of incoming requests with X-Ray.

Log Format The format in which Lambda sends your function's application and system logs to Cloud Watch. Select between plain text and structured JSON. Application Log Level Set this property to filter the application logs for your function that Lambda sends to Cloud Watch. Lambda only sends application logs at the selected level of detail and lower, where TRACE is the highest level and FATAL is the lowest. System Log Level Set this property to filter the system logs for your function that Lambda sends to Cloud Watch. Lambda only sends system logs at the selected level of detail and lower, where DEBUG is the highest level and WARN is the lowest.
