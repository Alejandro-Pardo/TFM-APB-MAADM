For Amazon Web Services services, you can also specify the ARN of the associated resource as the Source Arn.

    "with_service_params": "Service: Lambda. A low-level client representing AWS Lambda Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. For more information about the Lambda service, see What is Lambda in the Lambda Developer Guide. The Lambda API Reference provides information about each of the API methods, including details about the parameters in each API request and response. You can use Software Development Kits (SD Ks), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools to access the API. For installation instructions, see Tools for Amazon Web Services. For a list of Region-specific endpoints that Lambda supports, see Lambda endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.. When making the API calls, you will need to authenticate your request by providing a signature. Lambda supports signature version 4. For more information, see Signature Version 4 signing process in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.. Because Amazon Web Services SD Ks use the CA certificates from your computer, changes to the certificates on the Amazon Web Services servers can cause connection failures when you attempt to use an SDK. You can prevent these failures by keeping your computer's CA certificates and operating system up-to-date. If you encounter this issue in a corporate environment and do not manage your own computer, you might need to ask an administrator to assist with the update process. The following list shows minimum operating system and Java versions: Microsoft Windows versions that have updates from January 2005 or later installed contain at least one of the required C As in their trust list. Mac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 5 (February 2007), Mac OS X 10.5 (October 2007), and later versions contain at least one of the required C As in their trust list. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), 6, and 7 and Cent OS 5, 6, and 7 all contain at least one of the required C As in their default trusted CA list. Java 1.4.2_12 (May 2006), 5 Update 2 (March 2005), and all later versions, including Java 6 (December 2006), 7, and 8, contain at least one of the required C As in their default trusted CA list. When accessing the Lambda management console or Lambda API endpoints, whether through browsers or programmatically, you will need to ensure your client machines support any of the following C As: Amazon Root CA 1 Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority - G2 Starfield Class 2 Certification Authority Root certificates from the first two authorities are available from Amazon trust services, but keeping your computer up-to-date is the more straightforward solution. To learn more about ACM-provided certificates, see Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager FA Qs. Method: add permission. Grants a principal permission to use a function. You can apply the policy at the function level, or specify a qualifier to restrict access to a single version or alias. If you use a qualifier, the invoker must use the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of that version or alias to invoke the function. Note: Lambda does not support adding policies to version $LATEST.

This operation adds a statement to a resource-based permissions policy for the function. For more information about function policies, see Using resource-based policies for Lambda. Parameters: Function Name: The name or ARN of the Lambda function, version, or alias. Function name --- my-function (name-only), my-function:v1 (with alias). Function ARN --- arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function. Partial ARN --- 123456789012:function:my-function. You can append a version number or alias to any of the formats. The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length. | Statement Id: A statement identifier that differentiates the statement from others in the same policy. | Action: The action that the principal can use on the function. For example, lambda:Invoke Function or lambda:Get Function. | Principal: The Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Web Services account, IAM user, or IAM role that invokes the function. If you specify a service, use Source Arn or Source Account to limit who can invoke the function through that service. | Source Arn: For Amazon Web Services services, the ARN of the Amazon Web Services resource that invokes the function. For example, an Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon SNS topic. Note that Lambda configures the comparison using the String Like operator. | Source Account | Event Source Token | Qualifier | Revision Id | Principal Org ID | Function Url Auth Type",
