    "method_only": "modify db instance. Modifies settings for a DB instance. You can change one or more database configuration parameters by specifying these parameters and the new values in the request. To learn what modifications you can make to your DB instance, call Describe Valid DB Instance Modifications before you call Modify DB Instance.",
    "with_params": "modify db instance. Modifies settings for a DB instance. You can change one or more database configuration parameters by specifying these parameters and the new values in the request. To learn what modifications you can make to your DB instance, call Describe Valid DB Instance Modifications before you call Modify DB Instance. Parameters: DB Instance Identifier: The identifier of DB instance to modify. This value is stored as a lowercase string. Constraints: Must match the identifier of an existing DB instance. | Allocated Storage: The new amount of storage in gibibytes (Gi B) to allocate for the DB instance. For RDS for Db2, Maria DB, RDS for My SQL, RDS for Oracle, and RDS for Postgre SQL, the value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value. For the valid values for allocated storage for each engine, see Create DB Instance. Constraints: When you increase the allocated storage for a DB instance that uses Provisioned IOPS ( gp3, io1, or io2 storage type), you must also specify the Iops parameter. You can use the current value for Iops. | DB Instance Class: The new compute and memory capacity of the DB instance, for example db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all Amazon Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see DB Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide or Aurora DB instance classes in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. For RDS Custom, see DB instance class support for RDS Custom for Oracle and DB instance class support for RDS Custom for SQL Server. If you modify the DB instance class, an outage occurs during the change. The change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless you specify Apply Immediately in your request. Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: If you are modifying the DB instance class and upgrading the engine version at the same time, the currently running engine version must be supported on the specified DB instance class. Otherwise, the operation returns an error. In this case, first run the operation to upgrade the engine version, and then run it again to modify the DB instance class. | DB Subnet Group Name: The new DB subnet group for the DB instance. You can use this parameter to move your DB instance to a different VPC. If your DB instance isn't in a VPC, you can also use this parameter to move your DB instance into a VPC. For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Changing the subnet group causes an outage during the change. The change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless you enable Apply Immediately. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Constraints: If supplied, must match existing DB subnet group. Example: mydbsubnetgroup. | DB Security Groups: A list of DB security groups to authorize on this DB instance. Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Constraints: If supplied, must match existing DB security groups. | Vpc Security Group Ids: A list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this DB instance. This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances: Amazon Aurora (The associated list of EC2 VPC security groups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see Modify DB Cluster.) RDS Custom Constraints: If supplied, must match existing VPC security group I Ds. | Apply Immediately: Specifies whether the modifications in this request and any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of the Preferred Maintenance Window setting for the DB instance. By default, this parameter is disabled. If this parameter is disabled, changes to the DB instance are applied during the next maintenance window. Some parameter changes can cause an outage and are applied on the next call to Reboot DB Instance, or the next failure reboot. Review the table of parameters in Modifying a DB Instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide to see the impact of enabling or disabling Apply Immediately for each modified parameter and to determine when the changes are applied. | Master User Password: The new password for the master user. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Between the time of the request and the completion of the request, the Master User Password element exists in the Pending Modified Values element of the operation response. This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances: Amazon Aurora The password for the master user is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see Modify DB Cluster. RDS Custom RDS for Oracle CD Bs in the multi-tenant configuration Specify the master password in Modify Tenant Database instead. Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: Can't be specified if Manage Master User Password is turned on. Can include any printable ASCII character except '/', ''', or '@'. For RDS for Oracle, can't include the '&' (ampersand) or the ''' (single quotes) character. Length Constraints: RDS for Db2 - Must contain from 8 to 255 characters. RDS for Maria DB - Must contain from 8 to 41 characters. RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - Must contain from 8 to 128 characters. RDS for My SQL - Must contain from 8 to 41 characters. RDS for Oracle - Must contain from 8 to 30 characters. RDS for Postgre SQL - Must contain from 8 to 128 characters. | DB Parameter Group Name: The name of the DB parameter group to apply to the DB instance. Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage. The parameter group name itself is changed immediately, but the actual parameter changes are not applied until you reboot the instance without failover. In this case, the DB instance isn't rebooted automatically, and the parameter changes aren't applied during the next maintenance window. However, if you modify dynamic parameters in the newly associated DB parameter group, these changes are applied immediately without a reboot. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: Must be in the same DB parameter group family as the DB instance. | Backup Retention Period: The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables automated backups. These changes are applied during the next maintenance window unless the Apply Immediately parameter is enabled for this request. If you change the parameter from one non-zero value to another non-zero value, the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The retention period for automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see Modify DB Cluster. Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: Must be a value from 0 to 35. Can't be set to 0 if the DB instance is a source to read replicas. Can't be set to 0 for an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance. | Preferred Backup Window: The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, as determined by the Backup Retention Period parameter. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region. For more information, see Backup window in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The daily time range for creating automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see Modify DB Cluster. Constraints: Must be in the format hh24:mi-hh24:mi. Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window. Must be at least 30 minutes. | Preferred Maintenance Window: The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, which might result in an outage. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage, except in the following situation, and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If there are pending actions that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window is changed to include the current time, then changing this parameter causes a reboot of the DB instance. If you change this window to the current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the current time and end of the window to ensure pending changes are applied. For more information, see Amazon RDS Maintenance Window in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: Must be in the format ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi. The day values must be mon | tue | wed | thu | fri | sat | sun. Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Must not conflict with the preferred backup window. Must be at least 30 minutes. | Multi AZ: Specifies whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage. The change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the Apply Immediately parameter is enabled for this request. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Engine Version: The version number of the database engine to upgrade to. Changing this parameter results in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the Apply Immediately parameter is enabled for this request. For major version upgrades, if a nondefault DB parameter group is currently in use, a new DB parameter group in the DB parameter group family for the new engine version must be specified. The new DB parameter group can be the default for that DB parameter group family. If you specify only a major version, Amazon RDS updates the DB instance to the default minor version if the current minor version is lower. For information about valid engine versions, see Create DB Instance, or call Describe DB Engine Versions. If the instance that you're modifying is acting as a read replica, the engine version that you specify must be the same or higher than the version that the source DB instance or cluster is running. In RDS Custom for Oracle, this parameter is supported for read replicas only if they are in the PATCH_DB_FAILURE lifecycle. Constraints: If you are upgrading the engine version and modifying the DB instance class at the same time, the currently running engine version must be supported on the specified DB instance class. Otherwise, the operation returns an error. In this case, first run the operation to upgrade the engine version, and then run it again to modify the DB instance class. | Allow Major Version Upgrade: Specifies whether major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Constraints: Major version upgrades must be allowed when specifying a value for the Engine Version parameter that's a different major version than the DB instance's current version. | Auto Minor Version Upgrade: Specifies whether minor version upgrades are applied automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window. An outage occurs when all the following conditions are met: The automatic upgrade is enabled for the maintenance window. A newer minor version is available. RDS has enabled automatic patching for the engine version. If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, Amazon RDS applies the change as soon as possible and doesn't cause an outage. For an RDS Custom DB instance, don't enable this setting. Otherwise, the operation returns an error. For more information about automatic minor version upgrades, see Automatically upgrading the minor engine version. | License Model: The license model for the DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: RDS for Db2 - bring-your-own-license RDS for Maria DB - general-public-license RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - license-included RDS for My SQL - general-public-license RDS for Oracle - bring-your-own-license | license-included RDS for Postgre SQL - postgresql-license. | Iops: The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the RDS instance. Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the Apply Immediately parameter is enabled for this request. If you are migrating from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, set this value to 0. The DB instance will require a reboot for the change in storage type to take effect. If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to Provisioned IOPS (io1), or from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance. Constraints: For RDS for Maria DB, RDS for My SQL, RDS for Oracle, and RDS for Postgre SQL - The value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value. When you increase the Provisioned IOPS, you must also specify the Allocated Storage parameter. You can use the current value for Allocated Storage. Default: Uses existing setting. | Option Group Name: The option group to associate the DB instance with. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage, with one exception. If the parameter change results in an option group that enables OEM, it can cause a brief period, lasting less than a second, during which new connections are rejected but existing connections aren't interrupted. The change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the Apply Immediately parameter is enabled for this request. Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, can't be removed from an option group, and that option group can't be removed from a DB instance after it is associated with a DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | New DB Instance Identifier: The new identifier for the DB instance when renaming a DB instance. When you change the DB instance identifier, an instance reboot occurs immediately if you enable Apply Immediately, or will occur during the next maintenance window if you disable Apply Immediately. This value is stored as a lowercase string. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Constraints: Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens. The first character must be a letter. Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. Example: mydbinstance. | Storage Type: The storage type to associate with the DB instance. If you specify io1, io2, or gp3 you must also include a value for the Iops parameter. If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to gp2 (General Purpose SSD), gp3, or Provisioned IOPS (io1), or from these storage types to standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance. Valid Values: gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard Default: io1, if the Iops parameter is specified. Otherwise, gp2. | Tde Credential Arn: The ARN from the key store with which to associate the instance for TDE encryption. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Tde Credential Password: The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access the device. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | CA Certificate Identifier: The CA certificate identifier to use for the DB instance's server certificate. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. For more information, see Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide and Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. | Domain: The Active Directory directory ID to move the DB instance to. Specify none to remove the instance from its current domain. You must create the domain before this operation. Currently, you can create only Db2, My SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and Postgre SQL DB instances in an Active Directory Domain. For more information, see Kerberos Authentication in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Domain Fqdn: The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of an Active Directory domain. Constraints: Can't be longer than 64 characters. Example: mymanagedADtest.mymanagedAD.mydomain. | Domain Ou: The Active Directory organizational unit for your DB instance to join. Constraints: Must be in the distinguished name format. Can't be longer than 64 characters. Example: OU=mymanagedADtestOU,DC=mymanagedADtest,DC=mymanagedAD,DC=mydomain. | Domain Auth Secret Arn: The ARN for the Secrets Manager secret with the credentials for the user joining the domain. Example: arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account-number:secret:myselfmanagedADtestsecret-123456 | Domain Dns Ips: The IPv4 DNS IP addresses of your primary and secondary Active Directory domain controllers. Constraints: Two IP addresses must be provided. If there isn't a secondary domain controller, use the IP address of the primary domain controller for both entries in the list. Example: 123.124.125.126,234.235.236.237 | Copy Tags To Snapshot: Specifies whether to copy all tags from the DB instance to snapshots of the DB instance. By default, tags aren't copied. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Copying tags to snapshots is managed by the DB cluster. Setting this value for an Aurora DB instance has no effect on the DB cluster setting. For more information, see Modify DB Cluster. | Monitoring Interval: The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collection of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. If Monitoring Role Arn is specified, set Monitoring Interval to a value other than 0. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: 0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 60 Default: 0 | DB Port Number: The port number on which the database accepts connections. The value of the DB Port Number parameter must not match any of the port values specified for options in the option group for the DB instance. If you change the DB Port Number value, your database restarts regardless of the value of the Apply Immediately parameter. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: 1150-65535 Default: Amazon Aurora - 3306 RDS for Db2 - 50000 RDS for Maria DB - 3306 RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - 1433 RDS for My SQL - 3306 RDS for Oracle - 1521 RDS for Postgre SQL - 5432 Constraints: For RDS for Microsoft SQL Server, the value can't be 1234, 1434, 3260, 3343, 3389, 47001, or 49152-49156. | Publicly Accessible: Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible. When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from outside of the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC), its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB instance, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it. When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. Publicly Accessible only applies to DB instances in a VPC. The DB instance must be part of a public subnet and Publicly Accessible must be enabled for it to be publicly accessible. Changes to the Publicly Accessible parameter are applied immediately regardless of the value of the Apply Immediately parameter. | Monitoring Role Arn: The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon Cloud Watch Logs. For example, arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess. For information on creating a monitoring role, see To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring in the Amazon RDS User Guide. If Monitoring Interval is set to a value other than 0, supply a Monitoring Role Arn value. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Domain IAM Role Name: The name of the IAM role to use when making API calls to the Directory Service. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Disable Domain | Promotion Tier: The order of priority in which an Aurora Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the existing primary instance.

Default: 1 Valid Values: 0 - 15 | Enable IAM Database Authentication: Specifies whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts. By default, mapping isn't enabled. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora. Mapping Amazon Web Services IAM accounts to database accounts is managed by the DB cluster. For more information about IAM database authentication, see IAM Database Authentication for My SQL and Postgre SQL in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Database Insights Mode: Specifies the mode of Database Insights to enable for the DB instance. | Enable Performance Insights: Specifies whether to enable Performance Insights for the DB instance. For more information, see Using Amazon Performance Insights in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Performance Insights KMS Key Id: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. If you don't specify a value for Performance Insights KMS Key Id, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Performance Insights Retention Period: The number of days to retain Performance Insights data. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: 7 month * 31, where month is a number of months from 1-23. Examples: 93 (3 months * 31), 341 (11 months * 31), 589 (19 months * 31) 731 Default: 7 days If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as 94, Amazon RDS returns an error. | Cloudwatch Logs Export Configuration: The log types to be enabled for export to Cloud Watch Logs for a specific DB instance. A change to the Cloudwatch Logs Export Configuration parameter is always applied to the DB instance immediately. Therefore, the Apply Immediately parameter has no effect. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. The following values are valid for each DB engine: Aurora My SQL - audit | error | general | slowquery | iam-db-auth-error Aurora Postgre SQL - postgresql | iam-db-auth-error RDS for My SQL - error | general | slowquery | iam-db-auth-error RDS for Postgre SQL - postgresql | upgrade | iam-db-auth-error For more information about exporting Cloud Watch Logs for Amazon RDS, see Publishing Database Logs to Amazon Cloud Watch Logs in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

Enable Log Types The list of log types to enable. The following values are valid for each DB engine: Aurora My SQL - audit | error | general | slowquery Aurora Postgre SQL - postgresql RDS for My SQL - error | general | slowquery RDS for Postgre SQL - postgresql | upgrade Disable Log Types The list of log types to disable. The following values are valid for each DB engine: Aurora My SQL - audit | error | general | slowquery Aurora Postgre SQL - postgresql RDS for My SQL - error | general | slowquery RDS for Postgre SQL - postgresql | upgrade | Processor Features: The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Contains the processor features of a DB instance class. To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name for the Name parameter. You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions: Create DB Instance Modify DB Instance Restore DB Instance From DB Snapshot RestoreDBInstanceFromS3 Restore DB Instance To Point In Time You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the Describe Orderable DB Instance Options action and specifying the instance class for the DB Instance Class parameter. In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information: Describe DB Instances Describe DB Snapshots Describe Valid DB Instance Modifications If you call Describe DB Instances, Processor Feature returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met: You are accessing an Oracle DB instance. Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core. The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value. For more information, see Configuring the processor for a DB instance class in RDS for Oracle in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Name The name of the processor feature. Valid names are coreCount and threadsPerCore. Value The value of a processor feature. | Use Default Processor Features: Specifies whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its default processor features. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Deletion Protection: Specifies whether the DB instance has deletion protection enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For more information, see Deleting a DB Instance. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. You can enable or disable deletion protection for the DB cluster. For more information, see Modify DB Cluster. DB instances in a DB cluster can be deleted even when deletion protection is enabled for the DB cluster. | Max Allocated Storage: The upper limit in gibibytes (Gi B) to which Amazon RDS can automatically scale the storage of the DB instance. For more information about this setting, including limitations that apply to it, see Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Certificate Rotation Restart: Specifies whether the DB instance is restarted when you rotate your SSL/TLS certificate. By default, the DB instance is restarted when you rotate your SSL/TLS certificate. The certificate is not updated until the DB instance is restarted. If you are using SSL/TLS to connect to the DB instance, follow the appropriate instructions for your DB engine to rotate your SSL/TLS certificate: For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for RDS DB engines, see Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate. in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for Aurora DB engines, see Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Replica Mode: The open mode of a replica database. Standby DB replicas are included in Db2 Advanced Edition (AE) and Db2 Standard Edition (SE). The main use case for standby replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a standby replica can't serve a read-only workload. You can create a combination of standby and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for Db2 in the Amazon RDS User Guide. To create standby DB replicas for RDS for Db2, set this parameter to mounted. Oracle Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload. You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for Oracle in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For RDS Custom, you must specify this parameter and set it to mounted. The value won't be set by default. After replica creation, you can manage the open mode manually. | Enable Customer Owned Ip: Specifies whether to enable a customer-owned IP address (Co IP) for an RDS on Outposts DB instance. A Co IP provides local or external connectivity to resources in your Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For some use cases, a Co IP can provide lower latency for connections to the DB instance from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network. For more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For more information about Co I Ps, see Customer-owned IP addresses in the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide. | Aws Backup Recovery Point Arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recovery point in Amazon Web Services Backup. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Automation Mode | Resume Full Automation Mode Minutes: The number of minutes to pause the automation. When the time period ends, RDS Custom resumes full automation. Default: 60 Constraints: Must be at least 60. Must be no more than 1,440. | Network Type: The network type of the DB instance. The network type is determined by the DB Subnet Group specified for the DB instance. A DB Subnet Group can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols ( DUAL). For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Valid Values: IPV4 | DUAL. | Storage Throughput: The storage throughput value for the DB instance. This setting applies only to the gp3 storage type. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances. | Manage Master User Password: Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If the DB instance doesn't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can turn on this management. In this case, you can't specify Master User Password. If the DB instance already manages the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, and you specify that the master user password is not managed with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, then you must specify Master User Password. In this case, Amazon RDS deletes the secret and uses the new password for the master user specified by Master User Password. For more information, see Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Constraints: Can't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager if Master User Password is specified. Can't specify for RDS for Oracle CDB instances in the multi-tenant configuration. Use Modify Tenant Database instead. Can't specify the parameters Manage Master User Password and Multi Tenant in the same operation. | Rotate Master User Password: Specifies whether to rotate the secret managed by Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the master user password. This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance. The secret value contains the updated password. For more information, see Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Constraints: You must apply the change immediately when rotating the master user password. | Master User Secret Kms Key Id: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. This setting is valid only if both of the following conditions are met: The DB instance doesn't manage the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If the DB instance already manages the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can't change the KMS key used to encrypt the secret. You are turning on Manage Master User Password to manage the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If you are turning on Manage Master User Password and don't specify Master User Secret Kms Key Id, then the aws/secretsmanager KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the aws/secretsmanager KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS key. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. | Engine: The target Oracle DB engine when you convert a non-CDB to a CDB. This intermediate step is necessary to upgrade an Oracle Database 19c non-CDB to an Oracle Database 21c CDB. Note the following requirements: Make sure that you specify oracle-ee-cdb or oracle-se2-cdb. Make sure that your DB engine runs Oracle Database 19c with an April 2021 or later RU. Note the following limitations: You can't convert a CDB to a non-CDB. You can't convert a replica database. You can't convert a non-CDB to a CDB and upgrade the engine version in the same command. You can't convert the existing custom parameter or option group when it has options or parameters that are permanent or persistent. In this situation, the DB instance reverts to the default option and parameter group. To avoid reverting to the default, specify a new parameter group with --db-parameter-group-name and a new option group with --option-group-name. | Dedicated Log Volume | Multi Tenant: Specifies whether the to convert your DB instance from the single-tenant con\u00ef\u00ac\u0081guration to the multi-tenant con\u00ef\u00ac\u0081guration. This parameter is supported only for RDS for Oracle CDB instances. During the conversion, RDS creates an initial tenant database and associates the DB name, master user name, character set, and national character set metadata with this database. The tags associated with the instance also propagate to the initial tenant database. You can add more tenant databases to your DB instance by using the Create Tenant Database operation.",
    "with_params_returns": "modify db instance. Modifies settings for a DB instance. You can change one or more database configuration parameters by specifying these parameters and the new values in the request. To learn what modifications you can make to your DB instance, call Describe Valid DB Instance Modifications before you call Modify DB Instance. Parameters: DB Instance Identifier: The identifier of DB instance to modify. This value is stored as a lowercase string. Constraints: Must match the identifier of an existing DB instance. | Allocated Storage: The new amount of storage in gibibytes (Gi B) to allocate for the DB instance. For RDS for Db2, Maria DB, RDS for My SQL, RDS for Oracle, and RDS for Postgre SQL, the value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value. For the valid values for allocated storage for each engine, see Create DB Instance. Constraints: When you increase the allocated storage for a DB instance that uses Provisioned IOPS ( gp3, io1, or io2 storage type), you must also specify the Iops parameter. You can use the current value for Iops. | DB Instance Class: The new compute and memory capacity of the DB instance, for example db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all Amazon Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see DB Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide or Aurora DB instance classes in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. For RDS Custom, see DB instance class support for RDS Custom for Oracle and DB instance class support for RDS Custom for SQL Server. If you modify the DB instance class, an outage occurs during the change. The change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless you specify Apply Immediately in your request. Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: If you are modifying the DB instance class and upgrading the engine version at the same time, the currently running engine version must be supported on the specified DB instance class. Otherwise, the operation returns an error. In this case, first run the operation to upgrade the engine version, and then run it again to modify the DB instance class. | DB Subnet Group Name: The new DB subnet group for the DB instance. You can use this parameter to move your DB instance to a different VPC. If your DB instance isn't in a VPC, you can also use this parameter to move your DB instance into a VPC. For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Changing the subnet group causes an outage during the change. The change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless you enable Apply Immediately. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Constraints: If supplied, must match existing DB subnet group. Example: mydbsubnetgroup. | DB Security Groups: A list of DB security groups to authorize on this DB instance. Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Constraints: If supplied, must match existing DB security groups. | Vpc Security Group Ids: A list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this DB instance. This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances: Amazon Aurora (The associated list of EC2 VPC security groups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see Modify DB Cluster.) RDS Custom Constraints: If supplied, must match existing VPC security group I Ds. | Apply Immediately: Specifies whether the modifications in this request and any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of the Preferred Maintenance Window setting for the DB instance. By default, this parameter is disabled. If this parameter is disabled, changes to the DB instance are applied during the next maintenance window. Some parameter changes can cause an outage and are applied on the next call to Reboot DB Instance, or the next failure reboot. Review the table of parameters in Modifying a DB Instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide to see the impact of enabling or disabling Apply Immediately for each modified parameter and to determine when the changes are applied. | Master User Password: The new password for the master user. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Between the time of the request and the completion of the request, the Master User Password element exists in the Pending Modified Values element of the operation response. This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances: Amazon Aurora The password for the master user is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see Modify DB Cluster. RDS Custom RDS for Oracle CD Bs in the multi-tenant configuration Specify the master password in Modify Tenant Database instead. Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: Can't be specified if Manage Master User Password is turned on. Can include any printable ASCII character except '/', ''', or '@'. For RDS for Oracle, can't include the '&' (ampersand) or the ''' (single quotes) character. Length Constraints: RDS for Db2 - Must contain from 8 to 255 characters.

RDS for Oracle - Must contain from 8 to 30 characters. RDS for Postgre SQL - Must contain from 8 to 128 characters. | DB Parameter Group Name: The name of the DB parameter group to apply to the DB instance. Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage. The parameter group name itself is changed immediately, but the actual parameter changes are not applied until you reboot the instance without failover. In this case, the DB instance isn't rebooted automatically, and the parameter changes aren't applied during the next maintenance window. However, if you modify dynamic parameters in the newly associated DB parameter group, these changes are applied immediately without a reboot. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: Must be in the same DB parameter group family as the DB instance. | Backup Retention Period: The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables automated backups. These changes are applied during the next maintenance window unless the Apply Immediately parameter is enabled for this request. If you change the parameter from one non-zero value to another non-zero value, the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The retention period for automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see Modify DB Cluster. Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: Must be a value from 0 to 35. Can't be set to 0 if the DB instance is a source to read replicas. Can't be set to 0 for an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance. | Preferred Backup Window: The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, as determined by the Backup Retention Period parameter. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region. For more information, see Backup window in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The daily time range for creating automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see Modify DB Cluster. Constraints: Must be in the format hh24:mi-hh24:mi. Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window. Must be at least 30 minutes. | Preferred Maintenance Window: The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, which might result in an outage. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage, except in the following situation, and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If there are pending actions that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window is changed to include the current time, then changing this parameter causes a reboot of the DB instance. If you change this window to the current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the current time and end of the window to ensure pending changes are applied. For more information, see Amazon RDS Maintenance Window in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: Must be in the format ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi. The day values must be mon | tue | wed | thu | fri | sat | sun. Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Must not conflict with the preferred backup window. Must be at least 30 minutes. | Multi AZ: Specifies whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage. The change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the Apply Immediately parameter is enabled for this request. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Engine Version: The version number of the database engine to upgrade to. Changing this parameter results in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the Apply Immediately parameter is enabled for this request. For major version upgrades, if a nondefault DB parameter group is currently in use, a new DB parameter group in the DB parameter group family for the new engine version must be specified. The new DB parameter group can be the default for that DB parameter group family. If you specify only a major version, Amazon RDS updates the DB instance to the default minor version if the current minor version is lower. For information about valid engine versions, see Create DB Instance, or call Describe DB Engine Versions. If the instance that you're modifying is acting as a read replica, the engine version that you specify must be the same or higher than the version that the source DB instance or cluster is running. In RDS Custom for Oracle, this parameter is supported for read replicas only if they are in the PATCH_DB_FAILURE lifecycle. Constraints: If you are upgrading the engine version and modifying the DB instance class at the same time, the currently running engine version must be supported on the specified DB instance class. Otherwise, the operation returns an error. In this case, first run the operation to upgrade the engine version, and then run it again to modify the DB instance class. | Allow Major Version Upgrade: Specifies whether major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Constraints: Major version upgrades must be allowed when specifying a value for the Engine Version parameter that's a different major version than the DB instance's current version. | Auto Minor Version Upgrade: Specifies whether minor version upgrades are applied automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window. An outage occurs when all the following conditions are met: The automatic upgrade is enabled for the maintenance window. A newer minor version is available. RDS has enabled automatic patching for the engine version. If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, Amazon RDS applies the change as soon as possible and doesn't cause an outage. For an RDS Custom DB instance, don't enable this setting. Otherwise, the operation returns an error. For more information about automatic minor version upgrades, see Automatically upgrading the minor engine version. | License Model: The license model for the DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: RDS for Db2 - bring-your-own-license RDS for Maria DB - general-public-license RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - license-included RDS for My SQL - general-public-license RDS for Oracle - bring-your-own-license | license-included RDS for Postgre SQL - postgresql-license. | Iops: The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the RDS instance. Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the Apply Immediately parameter is enabled for this request. If you are migrating from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, set this value to 0. The DB instance will require a reboot for the change in storage type to take effect. If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to Provisioned IOPS (io1), or from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance. Constraints: For RDS for Maria DB, RDS for My SQL, RDS for Oracle, and RDS for Postgre SQL - The value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value. When you increase the Provisioned IOPS, you must also specify the Allocated Storage parameter. You can use the current value for Allocated Storage. Default: Uses existing setting. | Option Group Name: The option group to associate the DB instance with. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage, with one exception. If the parameter change results in an option group that enables OEM, it can cause a brief period, lasting less than a second, during which new connections are rejected but existing connections aren't interrupted. The change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the Apply Immediately parameter is enabled for this request. Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, can't be removed from an option group, and that option group can't be removed from a DB instance after it is associated with a DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | New DB Instance Identifier: The new identifier for the DB instance when renaming a DB instance. When you change the DB instance identifier, an instance reboot occurs immediately if you enable Apply Immediately, or will occur during the next maintenance window if you disable Apply Immediately. This value is stored as a lowercase string. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Constraints: Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens. The first character must be a letter. Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. Example: mydbinstance. | Storage Type: The storage type to associate with the DB instance. If you specify io1, io2, or gp3 you must also include a value for the Iops parameter. If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to gp2 (General Purpose SSD), gp3, or Provisioned IOPS (io1), or from these storage types to standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance. Valid Values: gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard Default: io1, if the Iops parameter is specified. Otherwise, gp2. | Tde Credential Arn: The ARN from the key store with which to associate the instance for TDE encryption. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Tde Credential Password: The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access the device. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | CA Certificate Identifier: The CA certificate identifier to use for the DB instance's server certificate. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. For more information, see Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide and Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. | Domain: The Active Directory directory ID to move the DB instance to. Specify none to remove the instance from its current domain. You must create the domain before this operation. Currently, you can create only Db2, My SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and Postgre SQL DB instances in an Active Directory Domain. For more information, see Kerberos Authentication in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Domain Fqdn: The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of an Active Directory domain. Constraints: Can't be longer than 64 characters.

Example: arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account-number:secret:myselfmanagedADtestsecret-123456 | Domain Dns Ips: The IPv4 DNS IP addresses of your primary and secondary Active Directory domain controllers. Constraints: Two IP addresses must be provided. If there isn't a secondary domain controller, use the IP address of the primary domain controller for both entries in the list. Example: 123.124.125.126,234.235.236.237 | Copy Tags To Snapshot: Specifies whether to copy all tags from the DB instance to snapshots of the DB instance. By default, tags aren't copied. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Copying tags to snapshots is managed by the DB cluster. Setting this value for an Aurora DB instance has no effect on the DB cluster setting. For more information, see Modify DB Cluster. | Monitoring Interval: The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collection of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. If Monitoring Role Arn is specified, set Monitoring Interval to a value other than 0. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: 0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 60 Default: 0 | DB Port Number: The port number on which the database accepts connections. The value of the DB Port Number parameter must not match any of the port values specified for options in the option group for the DB instance. If you change the DB Port Number value, your database restarts regardless of the value of the Apply Immediately parameter. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: 1150-65535 Default: Amazon Aurora - 3306 RDS for Db2 - 50000 RDS for Maria DB - 3306 RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - 1433 RDS for My SQL - 3306 RDS for Oracle - 1521 RDS for Postgre SQL - 5432 Constraints: For RDS for Microsoft SQL Server, the value can't be 1234, 1434, 3260, 3343, 3389, 47001, or 49152-49156. | Publicly Accessible: Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible. When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from outside of the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC), its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB instance, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it. When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. Publicly Accessible only applies to DB instances in a VPC. The DB instance must be part of a public subnet and Publicly Accessible must be enabled for it to be publicly accessible. Changes to the Publicly Accessible parameter are applied immediately regardless of the value of the Apply Immediately parameter. | Monitoring Role Arn: The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon Cloud Watch Logs. For example, arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess. For information on creating a monitoring role, see To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring in the Amazon RDS User Guide. If Monitoring Interval is set to a value other than 0, supply a Monitoring Role Arn value.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. If you don't specify a value for Performance Insights KMS Key Id, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Performance Insights Retention Period: The number of days to retain Performance Insights data. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: 7 month * 31, where month is a number of months from 1-23. Examples: 93 (3 months * 31), 341 (11 months * 31), 589 (19 months * 31) 731 Default: 7 days If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as 94, Amazon RDS returns an error. | Cloudwatch Logs Export Configuration: The log types to be enabled for export to Cloud Watch Logs for a specific DB instance. A change to the Cloudwatch Logs Export Configuration parameter is always applied to the DB instance immediately. Therefore, the Apply Immediately parameter has no effect. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. The following values are valid for each DB engine: Aurora My SQL - audit | error | general | slowquery | iam-db-auth-error Aurora Postgre SQL - postgresql | iam-db-auth-error RDS for My SQL - error | general | slowquery | iam-db-auth-error RDS for Postgre SQL - postgresql | upgrade | iam-db-auth-error For more information about exporting Cloud Watch Logs for Amazon RDS, see Publishing Database Logs to Amazon Cloud Watch Logs in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

The following values are valid for each DB engine: Aurora My SQL - audit | error | general | slowquery Aurora Postgre SQL - postgresql RDS for My SQL - error | general | slowquery RDS for Postgre SQL - postgresql | upgrade | Processor Features: The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Contains the processor features of a DB instance class. To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name for the Name parameter. You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions: Create DB Instance Modify DB Instance Restore DB Instance From DB Snapshot RestoreDBInstanceFromS3 Restore DB Instance To Point In Time You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the Describe Orderable DB Instance Options action and specifying the instance class for the DB Instance Class parameter. In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information: Describe DB Instances Describe DB Snapshots Describe Valid DB Instance Modifications If you call Describe DB Instances, Processor Feature returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met: You are accessing an Oracle DB instance. Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core. The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value. For more information, see Configuring the processor for a DB instance class in RDS for Oracle in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Name The name of the processor feature. Valid names are coreCount and threadsPerCore. Value The value of a processor feature. | Use Default Processor Features: Specifies whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its default processor features. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Deletion Protection: Specifies whether the DB instance has deletion protection enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For more information, see Deleting a DB Instance.

DB instances in a DB cluster can be deleted even when deletion protection is enabled for the DB cluster. | Max Allocated Storage: The upper limit in gibibytes (Gi B) to which Amazon RDS can automatically scale the storage of the DB instance. For more information about this setting, including limitations that apply to it, see Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Certificate Rotation Restart: Specifies whether the DB instance is restarted when you rotate your SSL/TLS certificate. By default, the DB instance is restarted when you rotate your SSL/TLS certificate. The certificate is not updated until the DB instance is restarted. If you are using SSL/TLS to connect to the DB instance, follow the appropriate instructions for your DB engine to rotate your SSL/TLS certificate: For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for RDS DB engines, see Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate. in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for Aurora DB engines, see Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Replica Mode: The open mode of a replica database. Standby DB replicas are included in Db2 Advanced Edition (AE) and Db2 Standard Edition (SE). The main use case for standby replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a standby replica can't serve a read-only workload. You can create a combination of standby and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for Db2 in the Amazon RDS User Guide. To create standby DB replicas for RDS for Db2, set this parameter to mounted. Oracle Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload. You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for Oracle in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For RDS Custom, you must specify this parameter and set it to mounted. The value won't be set by default. After replica creation, you can manage the open mode manually. | Enable Customer Owned Ip: Specifies whether to enable a customer-owned IP address (Co IP) for an RDS on Outposts DB instance. A Co IP provides local or external connectivity to resources in your Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For some use cases, a Co IP can provide lower latency for connections to the DB instance from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network. For more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For more information about Co I Ps, see Customer-owned IP addresses in the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide. | Aws Backup Recovery Point Arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recovery point in Amazon Web Services Backup.

When the time period ends, RDS Custom resumes full automation. Default: 60 Constraints: Must be at least 60. Must be no more than 1,440. | Network Type: The network type of the DB instance. The network type is determined by the DB Subnet Group specified for the DB instance. A DB Subnet Group can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols ( DUAL). For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Valid Values: IPV4 | DUAL. | Storage Throughput: The storage throughput value for the DB instance. This setting applies only to the gp3 storage type. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances. | Manage Master User Password: Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If the DB instance doesn't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can turn on this management. In this case, you can't specify Master User Password. If the DB instance already manages the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, and you specify that the master user password is not managed with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, then you must specify Master User Password. In this case, Amazon RDS deletes the secret and uses the new password for the master user specified by Master User Password. For more information, see Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Constraints: Can't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager if Master User Password is specified. Can't specify for RDS for Oracle CDB instances in the multi-tenant configuration. Use Modify Tenant Database instead. Can't specify the parameters Manage Master User Password and Multi Tenant in the same operation. | Rotate Master User Password: Specifies whether to rotate the secret managed by Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the master user password. This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance. The secret value contains the updated password. For more information, see Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Constraints: You must apply the change immediately when rotating the master user password. | Master User Secret Kms Key Id: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. This setting is valid only if both of the following conditions are met: The DB instance doesn't manage the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If the DB instance already manages the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can't change the KMS key used to encrypt the secret. You are turning on Manage Master User Password to manage the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If you are turning on Manage Master User Password and don't specify Master User Secret Kms Key Id, then the aws/secretsmanager KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the aws/secretsmanager KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS key. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. | Engine: The target Oracle DB engine when you convert a non-CDB to a CDB. This intermediate step is necessary to upgrade an Oracle Database 19c non-CDB to an Oracle Database 21c CDB. Note the following requirements: Make sure that you specify oracle-ee-cdb or oracle-se2-cdb. Make sure that your DB engine runs Oracle Database 19c with an April 2021 or later RU. Note the following limitations: You can't convert a CDB to a non-CDB. You can't convert a replica database. You can't convert a non-CDB to a CDB and upgrade the engine version in the same command. You can't convert the existing custom parameter or option group when it has options or parameters that are permanent or persistent. In this situation, the DB instance reverts to the default option and parameter group. To avoid reverting to the default, specify a new parameter group with --db-parameter-group-name and a new option group with --option-group-name. | Dedicated Log Volume | Multi Tenant: Specifies whether the to convert your DB instance from the single-tenant con\u00ef\u00ac\u0081guration to the multi-tenant con\u00ef\u00ac\u0081guration. This parameter is supported only for RDS for Oracle CDB instances. During the conversion, RDS creates an initial tenant database and associates the DB name, master user name, character set, and national character set metadata with this database. The tags associated with the instance also propagate to the initial tenant database. You can add more tenant databases to your DB instance by using the Create Tenant Database operation. Returns: DB Instance: Contains the details of an Amazon RDS DB instance."
