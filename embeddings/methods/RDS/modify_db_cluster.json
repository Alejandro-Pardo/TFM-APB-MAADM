For more information, see Using Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. Min Capacity The minimum number of Aurora capacity units (AC Us) for a DB instance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU values in half-step increments, such as 8, 8.5, 9, and so on. For Aurora versions that support the Aurora Serverless v2 auto-pause feature, the smallest value that you can use is 0. For versions that don't support Aurora Serverless v2 auto-pause, the smallest value that you can use is 0.5. Max Capacity The maximum number of Aurora capacity units (AC Us) for a DB instance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU values in half-step increments, such as 32, 32.5, 33, and so on. The largest value that you can use is 256 for recent Aurora versions, or 128 for older versions. Seconds Until Auto Pause Specifies the number of seconds an Aurora Serverless v2 DB instance must be idle before Aurora attempts to automatically pause it. Specify a value between 300 seconds (five minutes) and 86,400 seconds (one day). The default is 300 seconds. | Network Type: The network type of the DB cluster. The network type is determined by the DB Subnet Group specified for the DB cluster. A DB Subnet Group can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols ( DUAL). For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only Valid Values: IPV4 | DUAL. | Manage Master User Password: Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If the DB cluster doesn't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can turn on this management. In this case, you can't specify Master User Password. If the DB cluster already manages the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, and you specify that the master user password is not managed with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, then you must specify Master User Password. In this case, RDS deletes the secret and uses the new password for the master user specified by Master User Password. For more information, see Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide and Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters. | Rotate Master User Password: Specifies whether to rotate the secret managed by Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the master user password. This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB cluster. The secret value contains the updated password. For more information, see Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide and Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters Constraints: You must apply the change immediately when rotating the master user password. | Master User Secret Kms Key Id: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. This setting is valid only if both of the following conditions are met: The DB cluster doesn't manage the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If the DB cluster already manages the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can't change the KMS key that is used to encrypt the secret. You are turning on Manage Master User Password to manage the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If you are turning on Manage Master User Password and don't specify Master User Secret Kms Key Id, then the aws/secretsmanager KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the aws/secretsmanager KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS key. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters. | Engine Mode: The DB engine mode of the DB cluster, either provisioned or serverless. For more information, see Create DB Cluster. Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only. | Allow Engine Mode Change: Specifies whether engine mode changes from serverless to provisioned are allowed.
