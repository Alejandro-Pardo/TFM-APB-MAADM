Amazon Aurora doesn't support this operation. To create a DB instance for an Aurora DB cluster, use the Create DB Instance operation. RDS creates read replicas with backups disabled. All other attributes (including DB security groups and DB parameter groups) are inherited from the source DB instance or cluster, except as specified. Parameters: DB Instance Identifier: The DB instance identifier of the read replica. This identifier is the unique key that identifies a DB instance. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string. | Source DB Instance Identifier: The identifier of the DB instance that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB instance can have up to 15 read replicas, except for the following engines: Db2 - Can have up to three replicas. Oracle - Can have up to five read replicas. SQL Server - Can have up to five read replicas. Constraints: Must be the identifier of an existing Db2, Maria DB, My SQL, Oracle, Postgre SQL, or SQL Server DB instance. Can't be specified if the Source DB Cluster Identifier parameter is also specified. For the limitations of Oracle read replicas, see Version and licensing considerations for RDS for Oracle replicas in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For the limitations of SQL Server read replicas, see Read replica limitations with SQL Server in the Amazon RDS User Guide. The specified DB instance must have automatic backups enabled, that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0. If the source DB instance is in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the read replica, specify a valid DB instance identifier. If the source DB instance is in a different Amazon Web Services Region from the read replica, specify a valid DB instance ARN. For more information, see Constructing an ARN for Amazon RDS in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This doesn't apply to SQL Server or RDS Custom, which don't support cross-Region replicas. | DB Instance Class: The compute and memory capacity of the read replica, for example db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all Amazon Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see DB Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance. | Availability Zone: The Availability Zone (AZ) where the read replica will be created. Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's Amazon Web Services Region. Example: us-east-1d. | Port: The port number that the DB instance uses for connections. Valid Values: 1150-65535 Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance. | Multi AZ: Specifies whether the read replica is in a Multi-AZ deployment. You can create a read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance. RDS creates a standby of your replica in another Availability Zone for failover support for the replica. Creating your read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance is independent of whether the source is a Multi-AZ DB instance or a Multi-AZ DB cluster. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Auto Minor Version Upgrade: Specifies whether to automatically apply minor engine upgrades to the read replica during the maintenance window. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance. For more information about automatic minor version upgrades, see Automatically upgrading the minor engine version. | Iops | Option Group Name: The option group to associate the DB instance with. If not specified, RDS uses the option group associated with the source DB instance or cluster. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | DB Parameter Group Name: The name of the DB parameter group to associate with this read replica DB instance. For the Db2 DB engine, if your source DB instance uses the Bring Your Own License model, then a custom parameter group must be associated with the replica. For a same Amazon Web Services Region replica, if you don't specify a custom parameter group, Amazon RDS associates the custom parameter group associated with the source DB instance. For a cross-Region replica, you must specify a custom parameter group. This custom parameter group must include your IBM Site ID and IBM Customer ID. For more information, see IBM I Ds for Bring Your Own License for Db2. For Single-AZ or Multi-AZ DB instance read replica instances, if you don't specify a value for DB Parameter Group Name, then Amazon RDS uses the DB Parameter Group of the source DB instance for a same Region read replica, or the default DB Parameter Group for the specified DB engine for a cross-Region read replica. For Multi-AZ DB cluster same Region read replica instances, if you don't specify a value for DB Parameter Group Name, then Amazon RDS uses the default DB Parameter Group. Specifying a parameter group for this operation is only supported for My SQL DB instances for cross-Region read replicas, for Multi-AZ DB cluster read replica instances, for Db2 DB instances, and for Oracle DB instances. It isn't supported for My SQL DB instances for same Region read replicas or for RDS Custom. Constraints: Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens. First character must be a letter. Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. | Publicly Accessible: Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible. When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it. When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. For more information, see Create DB Instance. | Tags: A list of tags. For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS resources in the Amazon RDS User Guide or Tagging Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS resources in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. Metadata assigned to an Amazon RDS resource consisting of a key-value pair. Key A key is the required name of the tag. The string value can be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed with aws: or rds:. The string can only contain only the set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, --\u0098_', --\u0098.', --\u0098:', --\u0098/', --\u0098=', --\u0098+', --\u0098-', --\u0098@' (Java regex: '^([\\p{L}\\p{Z}\\p{N}_.:/=+\\-@]*)$'). Value A value is the optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed with aws: or rds:. The string can only contain only the set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, --\u0098_', --\u0098.', --\u0098:', --\u0098/', --\u0098=', --\u0098+', --\u0098-', --\u0098@' (Java regex: '^([\\p{L}\\p{Z}\\p{N}_.:/=+\\-@]*)$'). | DB Subnet Group Name: A DB subnet group for the DB instance. The new DB instance is created in the VPC associated with the DB subnet group. If no DB subnet group is specified, then the new DB instance isn't created in a VPC. Constraints: If supplied, must match the name of an existing DB subnet group. The specified DB subnet group must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region in which the operation is running. All read replicas in one Amazon Web Services Region that are created from the same source DB instance must either: Specify DB subnet groups from the same VPC. All these read replicas are created in the same VPC. Not specify a DB subnet group. All these read replicas are created outside of any VPC. Example: mydbsubnetgroup. | Vpc Security Group Ids: A list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to associate with the read replica. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Default: The default EC2 VPC security group for the DB subnet group's VPC. | Storage Type: The storage type to associate with the read replica. If you specify io1, io2, or gp3, you must also include a value for the Iops parameter. Valid Values: gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard Default: io1 if the Iops parameter is specified. Otherwise, gp3. | Copy Tags To Snapshot | Monitoring Interval: The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the read replica. To disable collection of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0. If Monitoring Role Arn is specified, then you must set Monitoring Interval to a value other than 0. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 Default: 0 | Monitoring Role Arn: The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon Cloud Watch Logs. For example, arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess. For information on creating a monitoring role, go to To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring in the Amazon RDS User Guide. If Monitoring Interval is set to a value other than 0, then you must supply a Monitoring Role Arn value. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Kms Key Id: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted read replica. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. If you create an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the source DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster, don't specify a value for this parameter. A read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region is always encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB instance or cluster. If you create an encrypted read replica in a different Amazon Web Services Region, then you must specify a KMS key identifier for the destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you can't use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon Web Services Region. You can't create an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom, which uses the same KMS key as the primary replica. | Pre Signed Url: When you are creating a read replica from one Amazon Web Services Gov Cloud (US) Region to another or from one China Amazon Web Services Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the Create DB Instance Read Replica API operation in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB instance. This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services Gov Cloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions. This setting applies only when replicating from a source DB instance. Source DB clusters aren't supported in Amazon Web Services Gov Cloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions. You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS API. Don't specify Pre Signed Url when you are creating an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region. The presigned URL must be a valid request for the Create DB Instance Read Replica API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values: Destination Region - The Amazon Web Services Region that the encrypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services Region is the same one where the Create DB Instance Read Replica operation is called that contains this presigned URL. For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1 Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the Create DB Instance Read Replica operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the Create DB Instance Read Replica operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the Destination Region in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region. Kms Key Id - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the Create DB Instance Read Replica operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL. Source DB Instance Identifier - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are creating an encrypted read replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your Source DB Instance Identifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115. To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Please note that this parameter is automatically populated if it is not provided. Including this parameter is not required. | Enable IAM Database Authentication: Specifies whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts. By default, mapping isn't enabled. For more information about IAM database authentication, see IAM Database Authentication for My SQL and Postgre SQL in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Database Insights Mode: The mode of Database Insights to enable for the read replica. | Enable Performance Insights: Specifies whether to enable Performance Insights for the read replica. For more information, see Using Amazon Performance Insights in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Performance Insights KMS Key Id: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. If you do not specify a value for Performance Insights KMS Key Id, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Performance Insights Retention Period: The number of days to retain Performance Insights data. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: 7 month * 31, where month is a number of months from 1-23. Examples: 93 (3 months * 31), 341 (11 months * 31), 589 (19 months * 31) 731 Default: 7 days If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as 94, Amazon RDS returns an error. | Enable Cloudwatch Logs Exports: The list of logs that the new DB instance is to export to Cloud Watch Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine being used. For more information, see Publishing Database Logs to Amazon Cloud Watch Logs in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Processor Features: The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Contains the processor features of a DB instance class. To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name for the Name parameter. You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions: Create DB Instance Modify DB Instance Restore DB Instance From DB Snapshot RestoreDBInstanceFromS3 Restore DB Instance To Point In Time You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the Describe Orderable DB Instance Options action and specifying the instance class for the DB Instance Class parameter. In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information: Describe DB Instances Describe DB Snapshots Describe Valid DB Instance Modifications If you call Describe DB Instances, Processor Feature returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met: You are accessing an Oracle DB instance. Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core. The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value. For more information, see Configuring the processor for a DB instance class in RDS for Oracle in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Name The name of the processor feature. Valid names are coreCount and threadsPerCore. Value The value of a processor feature. | Use Default Processor Features: Specifies whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its default processor features. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Deletion Protection | Domain: The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in.

Example: arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account-number:secret:myselfmanagedADtestsecret-123456 | Domain Dns Ips: The IPv4 DNS IP addresses of your primary and secondary Active Directory domain controllers. Constraints: Two IP addresses must be provided. If there isn't a secondary domain controller, use the IP address of the primary domain controller for both entries in the list. Example: 123.124.125.126,234.235.236.237 | Replica Mode: The open mode of the replica database. Standby DB replicas are included in Db2 Advanced Edition (AE) and Db2 Standard Edition (SE). The main use case for standby replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a standby replica can't serve a read-only workload. You can create a combination of standby and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for Db2 in the Amazon RDS User Guide. To create standby DB replicas for RDS for Db2, set this parameter to mounted. Oracle Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload. You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for Oracle in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For RDS Custom, you must specify this parameter and set it to mounted. The value won't be set by default. After replica creation, you can manage the open mode manually. | Max Allocated Storage: The upper limit in gibibytes (Gi B) to which Amazon RDS can automatically scale the storage of the DB instance. For more information about this setting, including limitations that apply to it, see Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling in the Amazon RDS User Guide. | Custom Iam Instance Profile: The instance profile associated with the underlying Amazon EC2 instance of an RDS Custom DB instance. The instance profile must meet the following requirements: The profile must exist in your account. The profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has permissions to assume. The instance profile name and the associated IAM role name must start with the prefix AWSRDS Custom. For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see Configure IAM and your VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting is required for RDS Custom DB instances. | Network Type: The network type of the DB instance. Valid Values: IPV4 DUAL The network type is determined by the DB Subnet Group specified for read replica. A DB Subnet Group can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols ( DUAL). For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide. | Storage Throughput: Specifies the storage throughput value for the read replica. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora DB instances. | Enable Customer Owned Ip: Specifies whether to enable a customer-owned IP address (Co IP) for an RDS on Outposts read replica. A Co IP provides local or external connectivity to resources in your Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For some use cases, a Co IP can provide lower latency for connections to the read replica from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network. For more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For more information about Co I Ps, see Customer-owned IP addresses in the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide. | Backup Target: The location where RDS stores automated backups and manual snapshots. Valid Values: local for Dedicated Local Zones region for Amazon Web Services Region. | Allocated Storage: The amount of storage (in gibibytes) to allocate initially for the read replica. Follow the allocation rules specified in Create DB Instance. This setting isn't valid for RDS for SQL Server. | Source DB Cluster Identifier: The identifier of the Multi-AZ DB cluster that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB cluster can have up to 15 read replicas. Constraints: Must be the identifier of an existing Multi-AZ DB cluster. Can't be specified if the Source DB Instance Identifier parameter is also specified. The specified DB cluster must have automatic backups enabled, that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0. The source DB cluster must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the read replica. Cross-Region replication isn't supported. | Dedicated Log Volume | Upgrade Storage Config | CA Certificate Identifier: The CA certificate identifier to use for the read replica's server certificate. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

If Monitoring Interval is set to a value other than 0, then you must supply a Monitoring Role Arn value. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Kms Key Id: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted read replica. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. If you create an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the source DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster, don't specify a value for this parameter. A read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region is always encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB instance or cluster. If you create an encrypted read replica in a different Amazon Web Services Region, then you must specify a KMS key identifier for the destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you can't use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon Web Services Region. You can't create an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom, which uses the same KMS key as the primary replica. | Pre Signed Url: When you are creating a read replica from one Amazon Web Services Gov Cloud (US) Region to another or from one China Amazon Web Services Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the Create DB Instance Read Replica API operation in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB instance. This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services Gov Cloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions. This setting applies only when replicating from a source DB instance. Source DB clusters aren't supported in Amazon Web Services Gov Cloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions. You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS API. Don't specify Pre Signed Url when you are creating an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region. The presigned URL must be a valid request for the Create DB Instance Read Replica API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values: Destination Region - The Amazon Web Services Region that the encrypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services Region is the same one where the Create DB Instance Read Replica operation is called that contains this presigned URL. For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1 Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the Create DB Instance Read Replica operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the Create DB Instance Read Replica operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the Destination Region in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region. Kms Key Id - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the Create DB Instance Read Replica operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL. Source DB Instance Identifier - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are creating an encrypted read replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your Source DB Instance Identifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115. To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Please note that this parameter is automatically populated if it is not provided. Including this parameter is not required. | Enable IAM Database Authentication: Specifies whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts. By default, mapping isn't enabled. For more information about IAM database authentication, see IAM Database Authentication for My SQL and Postgre SQL in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Database Insights Mode: The mode of Database Insights to enable for the read replica. | Enable Performance Insights: Specifies whether to enable Performance Insights for the read replica. For more information, see Using Amazon Performance Insights in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Performance Insights KMS Key Id: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. If you do not specify a value for Performance Insights KMS Key Id, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Performance Insights Retention Period: The number of days to retain Performance Insights data. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: 7 month * 31, where month is a number of months from 1-23. Examples: 93 (3 months * 31), 341 (11 months * 31), 589 (19 months * 31) 731 Default: 7 days If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as 94, Amazon RDS returns an error. | Enable Cloudwatch Logs Exports: The list of logs that the new DB instance is to export to Cloud Watch Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine being used. For more information, see Publishing Database Logs to Amazon Cloud Watch Logs in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Processor Features: The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Contains the processor features of a DB instance class. To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name for the Name parameter. You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions: Create DB Instance Modify DB Instance Restore DB Instance From DB Snapshot RestoreDBInstanceFromS3 Restore DB Instance To Point In Time You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the Describe Orderable DB Instance Options action and specifying the instance class for the DB Instance Class parameter. In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information: Describe DB Instances Describe DB Snapshots Describe Valid DB Instance Modifications If you call Describe DB Instances, Processor Feature returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met: You are accessing an Oracle DB instance. Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core. The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value. For more information, see Configuring the processor for a DB instance class in RDS for Oracle in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Name The name of the processor feature. Valid names are coreCount and threadsPerCore. Value The value of a processor feature. | Use Default Processor Features: Specifies whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its default processor features. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Deletion Protection | Domain: The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in. Currently, only My SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and Postgre SQL DB instances can be created in an Active Directory Domain. For more information, see Kerberos Authentication in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Domain IAM Role Name: The name of the IAM role to use when making API calls to the Directory Service. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. | Domain Fqdn: The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of an Active Directory domain. Constraints: Can't be longer than 64 characters. Example: mymanagedADtest.mymanagedAD.mydomain. | Domain Ou: The Active Directory organizational unit for your DB instance to join. Constraints: Must be in the distinguished name format. Can't be longer than 64 characters. Example: OU=mymanagedADtestOU,DC=mymanagedADtest,DC=mymanagedAD,DC=mydomain. | Domain Auth Secret Arn: The ARN for the Secrets Manager secret with the credentials for the user joining the domain. Example: arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account-number:secret:myselfmanagedADtestsecret-123456 | Domain Dns Ips: The IPv4 DNS IP addresses of your primary and secondary Active Directory domain controllers. Constraints: Two IP addresses must be provided. If there isn't a secondary domain controller, use the IP address of the primary domain controller for both entries in the list. Example: 123.124.125.126,234.235.236.237 | Replica Mode: The open mode of the replica database. Standby DB replicas are included in Db2 Advanced Edition (AE) and Db2 Standard Edition (SE). The main use case for standby replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a standby replica can't serve a read-only workload. You can create a combination of standby and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for Db2 in the Amazon RDS User Guide. To create standby DB replicas for RDS for Db2, set this parameter to mounted. Oracle Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload. You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for Oracle in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For RDS Custom, you must specify this parameter and set it to mounted. The value won't be set by default. After replica creation, you can manage the open mode manually. | Max Allocated Storage: The upper limit in gibibytes (Gi B) to which Amazon RDS can automatically scale the storage of the DB instance. For more information about this setting, including limitations that apply to it, see Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling in the Amazon RDS User Guide. | Custom Iam Instance Profile: The instance profile associated with the underlying Amazon EC2 instance of an RDS Custom DB instance. The instance profile must meet the following requirements: The profile must exist in your account. The profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has permissions to assume. The instance profile name and the associated IAM role name must start with the prefix AWSRDS Custom. For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see Configure IAM and your VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting is required for RDS Custom DB instances. | Network Type: The network type of the DB instance. Valid Values: IPV4 DUAL The network type is determined by the DB Subnet Group specified for read replica. A DB Subnet Group can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols ( DUAL). For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide. | Storage Throughput: Specifies the storage throughput value for the read replica. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora DB instances. | Enable Customer Owned Ip: Specifies whether to enable a customer-owned IP address (Co IP) for an RDS on Outposts read replica. A Co IP provides local or external connectivity to resources in your Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For some use cases, a Co IP can provide lower latency for connections to the read replica from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network. For more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For more information about Co I Ps, see Customer-owned IP addresses in the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide. | Backup Target: The location where RDS stores automated backups and manual snapshots. Valid Values: local for Dedicated Local Zones region for Amazon Web Services Region. | Allocated Storage: The amount of storage (in gibibytes) to allocate initially for the read replica. Follow the allocation rules specified in Create DB Instance. This setting isn't valid for RDS for SQL Server. | Source DB Cluster Identifier: The identifier of the Multi-AZ DB cluster that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB cluster can have up to 15 read replicas. Constraints: Must be the identifier of an existing Multi-AZ DB cluster. Can't be specified if the Source DB Instance Identifier parameter is also specified. The specified DB cluster must have automatic backups enabled, that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0. The source DB cluster must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the read replica. Cross-Region replication isn't supported. | Dedicated Log Volume | Upgrade Storage Config | CA Certificate Identifier: The CA certificate identifier to use for the read replica's server certificate. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. For more information, see Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide and Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. | Source Region Returns: DB Instance: Contains the details of an Amazon RDS DB instance."
