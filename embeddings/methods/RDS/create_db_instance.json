When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from outside of the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC), its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB instance, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it. When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether DB Subnet Group Name is specified. If DB Subnet Group Name isn't specified, and Publicly Accessible isn't specified, the following applies: If the default VPC in the target Region doesn't have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB instance is private. If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB instance is public. If DB Subnet Group Name is specified, and Publicly Accessible isn't specified, the following applies: If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn't have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB instance is private. If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB instance is public. | Tags: Tags to assign to the DB instance.

To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN. If you don't specify Master User Secret Kms Key Id, then the aws/secretsmanager KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the aws/secretsmanager KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. | CA Certificate Identifier: The CA certificate identifier to use for the DB instance's server certificate. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. For more information, see Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide and Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. | DB System Id | Dedicated Log Volume | Multi Tenant: Specifies whether to use the multi-tenant configuration or the single-tenant configuration (default). This parameter only applies to RDS for Oracle container database (CDB) engines. Note the following restrictions: The DB engine that you specify in the request must support the multi-tenant configuration. If you attempt to enable the multi-tenant configuration on a DB engine that doesn't support it, the request fails. If you specify the multi-tenant configuration when you create your DB instance, you can't later modify this DB instance to use the single-tenant configuration. | Engine Lifecycle Support: The life cycle type for this DB instance. This setting applies only to RDS for My SQL and RDS for Postgre SQL. For Amazon Aurora DB instances, the life cycle type is managed by the DB cluster. You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB instance past the end of standard support for that engine version. For more information, see Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon RDS in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Valid Values: open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled Default: open-source-rds-extended-support. Returns: DB Instance: Contains the details of an Amazon RDS DB instance."
