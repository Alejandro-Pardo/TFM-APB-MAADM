    "method_only": "restore db instance from db snapshot. Creates a new DB instance from a DB snapshot. The target database is created from the source database restore point with most of the source's original configuration, including the default security group and DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a Single-AZ deployment, except when the instance is a SQL Server instance that has an option group associated with mirroring. In this case, the instance becomes a Multi-AZ deployment, not a Single-AZ deployment. If you want to replace your original DB instance with the new, restored DB instance, then rename your original DB instance before you call the Restore DB Instance From DB Snapshot operation. RDS doesn't allow two DB instances with the same name. After you have renamed your original DB instance with a different identifier, then you can pass the original name of the DB instance as the DB Instance Identifier in the call to the Restore DB Instance From DB Snapshot operation. The result is that you replace the original DB instance with the DB instance created from the snapshot. If you are restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, the DB Snapshot Identifier must be the ARN of the shared DB snapshot. To restore from a DB snapshot with an unsupported engine version, you must first upgrade the engine version of the snapshot.

In most cases, tags aren't copied by default. However, when you restore a DB instance from a DB snapshot, RDS checks whether you specify new tags. If yes, the new tags are added to the restored DB instance.

To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN. If you don't specify Master User Secret Kms Key Id, then the aws/secretsmanager KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the aws/secretsmanager KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.",

For some use cases, a Co IP can provide lower latency for connections to the DB instance from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom. For more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For more information about Co I Ps, see Customer-owned IP addresses in the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide. | Custom Iam Instance Profile: The instance profile associated with the underlying Amazon EC2 instance of an RDS Custom DB instance. The instance profile must meet the following requirements: The profile must exist in your account. The profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has permissions to assume. The instance profile name and the associated IAM role name must start with the prefix AWSRDS Custom. For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see Configure IAM and your VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting is required for RDS Custom. | Backup Target: Specifies where automated backups and manual snapshots are stored for the restored DB instance. Possible values are local (Dedicated Local Zone), outposts (Amazon Web Services Outposts), and region (Amazon Web Services Region). The default is region. For more information, see Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide. | Network Type: The network type of the DB instance. Valid Values: IPV4 DUAL The network type is determined by the DB Subnet Group specified for the DB instance. A DB Subnet Group can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols ( DUAL). For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide. | Storage Throughput: Specifies the storage throughput value for the DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora. | DB Cluster Snapshot Identifier: The identifier for the Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot to restore from. For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Constraints: Must match the identifier of an existing Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot. Can't be specified when DB Snapshot Identifier is specified. Must be specified when DB Snapshot Identifier isn't specified. If you are restoring from a shared manual Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot, the DB Cluster Snapshot Identifier must be the ARN of the shared snapshot. Can't be the identifier of an Aurora DB cluster snapshot. | Allocated Storage: The amount of storage (in gibibytes) to allocate initially for the DB instance. Follow the allocation rules specified in Create DB Instance. This setting isn't valid for RDS for SQL Server. | Dedicated Log Volume | CA Certificate Identifier: The CA certificate identifier to use for the DB instance's server certificate. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. For more information, see Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide and Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. | Engine Lifecycle Support: The life cycle type for this DB instance. You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB instance past the end of standard support for that engine version. For more information, see Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon RDS in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting applies only to RDS for My SQL and RDS for Postgre SQL. For Amazon Aurora DB instances, the life cycle type is managed by the DB cluster. Valid Values: open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled Default: open-source-rds-extended-support. | Manage Master User Password: Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager in the restored DB instance. For more information, see Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide. Constraints: Applies to RDS for Oracle only. | Master User Secret Kms Key Id: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN. If you don't specify Master User Secret Kms Key Id, then the aws/secretsmanager KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the aws/secretsmanager KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. Returns: DB Instance: Contains the details of an Amazon RDS DB instance."
