That public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it. When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether DB Subnet Group Name is specified.

For versions that don't support Aurora Serverless v2 auto-pause, the smallest value that you can use is 0.5. Max Capacity The maximum number of Aurora capacity units (AC Us) for a DB instance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU values in half-step increments, such as 32, 32.5, 33, and so on. The largest value that you can use is 256 for recent Aurora versions, or 128 for older versions.

If Monitoring Interval is set to a value other than 0, supply a Monitoring Role Arn value. | Enable Performance Insights | Performance Insights KMS Key Id: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. If you don't specify a value for Performance Insights KMS Key Id, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. | Performance Insights Retention Period: The number of days to retain Performance Insights data. Valid Values: 7 month * 31, where month is a number of months from 1-23.

Valid Values: IPV4 DUAL The network type is determined by the DB Subnet Group specified for the DB cluster. A DB Subnet Group can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols ( DUAL). For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only. | Source Db Cluster Resource Id | Rds Custom Cluster Configuration: Reserved for future use. Interconnect Subnet Id Reserved for future use. Transit Gateway Multicast Domain Id Reserved for future use. Replica Mode Reserved for future use. | Monitoring Interval: The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB cluster. To turn off collecting Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. If Monitoring Role Arn is specified, also set Monitoring Interval to a value other than 0. Valid Values: 0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 60 Default: 0 | Monitoring Role Arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that permits RDS to send Enhanced Monitoring metrics to Amazon Cloud Watch Logs. An example is arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess. If Monitoring Interval is set to a value other than 0, supply a Monitoring Role Arn value. | Enable Performance Insights | Performance Insights KMS Key Id: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. If you don't specify a value for Performance Insights KMS Key Id, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. | Performance Insights Retention Period: The number of days to retain Performance Insights data. Valid Values: 7 month * 31, where month is a number of months from 1-23. Examples: 93 (3 months * 31), 341 (11 months * 31), 589 (19 months * 31) 731 Default: 7 days If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as 94, Amazon RDS issues an error. | Engine Lifecycle Support: The life cycle type for this DB cluster. You can use this setting to enroll your DB cluster into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB cluster past the end of standard support for that engine version. For more information, see the following sections: Amazon Aurora - Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon Aurora in the Amazon Aurora User Guide Amazon RDS - Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon RDS in the Amazon RDS User Guide Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters Valid Values: open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled Default: open-source-rds-extended-support. Returns: DB Cluster: Contains the details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or Multi-AZ DB cluster."
