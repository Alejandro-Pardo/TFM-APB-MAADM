Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the nodes (for example, to support kubectl exec, logs, and proxy data flows). Amazon EKS nodes run in your Amazon Web Services account and connect to your cluster's control plane over the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster. You can use the endpointPublicAccess and endpointPrivateAccess parameters to enable or disable public and private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. By default, public access is enabled, and private access is disabled. For more information, see Amazon EKS Cluster Endpoint Access Control in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

If you don't specify a value here, the default version available in Amazon EKS is used. | role Arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that provides permissions for the Kubernetes control plane to make calls to Amazon Web Services API operations on your behalf. For more information, see Amazon EKS Service IAM Role in the Amazon EKS User Guide . | resources Vpc Config: The VPC configuration that's used by the cluster control plane. Amazon EKS VPC resources have specific requirements to work properly with Kubernetes. For more information, see Cluster VPC Considerations and Cluster Security Group Considerations in the Amazon EKS User Guide. You must specify at least two subnets. You can specify up to five security groups. However, we recommend that you use a dedicated security group for your cluster control plane. subnetIds Specify subnets for your Amazon EKS nodes. Amazon EKS creates cross-account elastic network interfaces in these subnets to allow communication between your nodes and the Kubernetes control plane. securityGroupIds Specify one or more security groups for the cross-account elastic network interfaces that Amazon EKS creates to use that allow communication between your nodes and the Kubernetes control plane. If you don't specify any security groups, then familiarize yourself with the difference between Amazon EKS defaults for clusters deployed with Kubernetes. For more information, see Amazon EKS security group considerations in the Amazon EKS User Guide . endpointPublicAccess Set this value to false to disable public access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. If you disable public access, your cluster's Kubernetes API server can only receive requests from within the cluster VPC. The default value for this parameter is true, which enables public access for your Kubernetes API server. For more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access control in the Amazon EKS User Guide . endpointPrivateAccess Set this value to true to enable private access for your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. If you enable private access, Kubernetes API requests from within your cluster's VPC use the private VPC endpoint. The default value for this parameter is false, which disables private access for your Kubernetes API server. If you disable private access and you have nodes or Fargate pods in the cluster, then ensure that publicAccessCidrs includes the necessary CIDR blocks for communication with the nodes or Fargate pods. publicAccessCidrs The CIDR blocks that are allowed access to your cluster's public Kubernetes API server endpoint. Communication to the endpoint from addresses outside of the CIDR blocks that you specify is denied. The default value is 0.0.0.0/0.

The CIDR block to assign Kubernetes service IP addresses from. If you don't specify a block, Kubernetes assigns addresses from either the 10.100.0.0/16 or 172.20.0.0/16 CIDR blocks. We recommend that you specify a block that does not overlap with resources in other networks that are peered or connected to your VPC. The block must meet the following requirements: Within one of the following private IP address blocks: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16. Doesn't overlap with any CIDR block assigned to the VPC that you selected for VPC. Between /24 and /12. ipFamily Specify which IP family is used to assign Kubernetes pod and service IP addresses. If you don't specify a value, ipv4 is used by default. You can only specify an IP family when you create a cluster and can't change this value once the cluster is created. If you specify ipv6, the VPC and subnets that you specify for cluster creation must have both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks assigned to them. You can't specify ipv6 for clusters in China Regions. You can only specify ipv6 for 1.21 and later clusters that use version 1.10.1 or later of the Amazon VPC CNI add-on. If you specify ipv6, then ensure that your VPC meets the requirements listed in the considerations listed in Assigning IPv6 addresses to pods and services in the Amazon EKS User Guide. Kubernetes assigns services IPv6 addresses from the unique local address range (fc00::/7). You can't specify a custom IPv6 CIDR block.

You can disable extended support when creating a cluster by setting this value to STANDARD. supportType If the cluster is set to EXTENDED, it will enter extended support at the end of standard support. If the cluster is set to STANDARD, it will be automatically upgraded at the end of standard support. Learn more about EKS Extended Support in the Amazon EKS User Guide. | zonal Shift Config: Enable or disable ARC zonal shift for the cluster. If zonal shift is enabled, Amazon Web Services configures zonal autoshift for the cluster. Zonal shift is a feature of Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC). ARC zonal shift is designed to be a temporary measure that allows you to move traffic for a resource away from an impaired AZ until the zonal shift expires or you cancel it. You can extend the zonal shift if necessary. You can start a zonal shift for an Amazon EKS cluster, or you can allow Amazon Web Services to do it for you by enabling zonal autoshift. This shift updates the flow of east-to-west network traffic in your cluster to only consider network endpoints for Pods running on worker nodes in healthy A Zs. Additionally, any ALB or NLB handling ingress traffic for applications in your Amazon EKS cluster will automatically route traffic to targets in the healthy A Zs. For more information about zonal shift in EKS, see Learn about Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) Zonal Shift in Amazon EKS in the Amazon EKS User Guide . enabled If zonal shift is enabled, Amazon Web Services configures zonal autoshift for the cluster. | remote Network Config: The configuration in the cluster for EKS Hybrid Nodes.

Each block must have a route to the VPC that uses the VPC CIDR blocks, not public I Ps or Elastic I Ps. There are many options including Transit Gateway, Site-to-Site VPN, or Direct Connect. Each host must allow outbound connection to the EKS cluster control plane on TCP ports 443 and 10250. Each host must allow inbound connection from the EKS cluster control plane on TCP port 10250 for logs, exec and port-forward operations.
