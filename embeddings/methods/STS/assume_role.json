The temporary security credentials created by Assume Role can be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: You cannot call the Amazon Web Services STS Get Federation Token or Get Session Token API operations. (Optional) You can pass inline or managed session policies to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (AR Ns) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM User Guide. When you create a role, you create two policies: a role trust policy that specifies who can assume the role, and a permissions policy that specifies what can be done with the role. You specify the trusted principal that is allowed to assume the role in the role trust policy. To assume a role from a different account, your Amazon Web Services account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call Assume Role for the ARN of the role in the other account. To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either of the following: You can do either because the role's trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is required. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see IAM Policies in the IAM User Guide. (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see Passing Session Tags in STS in the IAM User Guide. An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control in the IAM User Guide. You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see Chaining Roles with Session Tags in the IAM User Guide. (Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call Assume Role. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an Amazon Web Services MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example. \"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:Multi Factor Auth Present\": true}} For more information, see Configuring MFA-Protected API Access in the IAM User Guide guide. To use MFA with Assume Role, you pass values for the Serial Number and Token Code parameters. The Serial Number value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device.

The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example. \"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:Multi Factor Auth Present\": true}} For more information, see Configuring MFA-Protected API Access in the IAM User Guide guide. To use MFA with Assume Role, you pass values for the Serial Number and Token Code parameters. The Serial Number value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The Token Code is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces. Parameters: Role Arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume. | Role Session Name: An identifier for the assumed role session. Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons. In cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security credentials will expose the role session name to the external account in their Cloud Trail logs. For security purposes, administrators can view this field in Cloud Trail logs to help identify who performed an action in Amazon Web Services. Your administrator might require that you specify your user name as the session name when you assume the role. For more information, see sts:Role Session Name. The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@- | Policy Arns: The Amazon Resource Names (AR Ns) of the IAM managed policies that you want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the same account as the role. This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy AR Ns. However, the plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. For more information about AR Ns, see Amazon Resource Names (AR Ns) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM User Guide. A reference to the IAM managed policy that is passed as a session policy for a role session or a federated user session. arn The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM managed policy to use as a session policy for the role. For more information about AR Ns, see Amazon Resource Names (AR Ns) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. | Policy: An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session policy. This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM User Guide. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (u0020 through u00FF). It can also include the tab (u0009), linefeed (u000A), and carriage return (u000D) characters. For more information about role session permissions, see Session policies. | Duration Seconds: The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value specified can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration set for the role. The maximum session duration setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting or the administrator setting (whichever is lower), the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails. Role chaining limits your Amazon Web Services CLI or Amazon Web Services API role session to a maximum of one hour. When you use the Assume Role API operation to assume a role, you can specify the duration of your role session with the Duration Seconds parameter. You can specify a parameter value of up to 43200 seconds (12 hours), depending on the maximum session duration setting for your role. However, if you assume a role using role chaining and provide a Duration Seconds parameter value greater than one hour, the operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see Update the maximum session duration for a role. By default, the value is set to 3600 seconds. | Tags: A list of session tags that you want to pass. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see Tagging Amazon Web Services STS Sessions in the IAM User Guide. This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session tag keys can't exceed 128 characters, and the values can't exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see IAM and STS Character Limits in the IAM User Guide. You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already attached to the role. When you do, session tags override a role tag with the same key. Tag key---value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate Department and department tag keys. Assume that the role has the Department``= ``Marketing tag and you pass the department``= ``engineering session tag. Department and department are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the role tag. Additionally, if you used temporary credentials to perform this operation, the new session inherits any transitive session tags from the calling session. If you pass a session tag with the same key as an inherited tag, the operation fails. To view the inherited tags for a session, see the Cloud Trail logs. For more information, see Viewing Session Tags in Cloud Trail in the IAM User Guide. You can pass custom key-value pair attributes when you assume a role or federate a user. These are called session tags. You can then use the session tags to control access to resources. For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services STS Sessions in the IAM User Guide. The key for a session tag. The plain text session tag keys can't exceed 128 characters. The value for a session tag. The plain text session tag values can't exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see IAM and STS Character Limits in the IAM User Guide. | Transitive Tag Keys: A list of keys for session tags that you want to set as transitive. If you set a tag key as transitive, the corresponding key and value passes to subsequent sessions in a role chain. For more information, see Chaining Roles with Session Tags in the IAM User Guide. This parameter is optional. The transitive status of a session tag does not impact its packed binary size. If you choose not to specify a transitive tag key, then no tags are passed from this session to any subsequent sessions. | External Id: A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the External Id parameter. This value can be any string, such as a passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role, rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the external ID, see How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your Amazon Web Services Resources to a Third Party in the IAM User Guide. The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/- | Serial Number: The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the user who is making the Assume Role call. Specify this value if the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as GAHT12345678) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user). The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@- | Token Code: The value provided by the MFA device, if the trust policy of the role being assumed requires MFA. (In other words, if the policy includes a condition that tests for MFA). If the role being assumed requires MFA and if the Token Code value is missing or expired, the Assume Role call returns an 'access denied' error. The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a sequence of six numeric digits. | Source Identity: The source identity specified by the principal that is calling the Assume Role operation. The source identity value persists across chained role sessions. You can require users to specify a source identity when they assume a role. You do this by using the sts:Source Identity condition key in a role trust policy. You can use source identity information in Cloud Trail logs to determine who took actions with a role. You can use the aws:Source Identity condition key to further control access to Amazon Web Services resources based on the value of source identity. For more information about using source identity, see Monitor and control actions taken with assumed roles in the IAM User Guide. The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: +=,.@-. You cannot use a value that begins with the text aws:. This prefix is reserved for Amazon Web Services internal use. | Provided Contexts: A list of previously acquired trusted context assertions in the format of a JSON array. The trusted context assertion is signed and encrypted by Amazon Web Services STS. The following is an example of a Provided Context value that includes a single trusted context assertion and the ARN of the context provider from which the trusted context assertion was generated. [{\"Provider Arn\":\"arn:aws:iam::aws:contextProvider/Identity Center\",\"Context Assertion\":\"trusted-context-assertion\"}] Contains information about the provided context. This includes the signed and encrypted trusted context assertion and the context provider ARN from which the trusted context assertion was generated.
