The active version is typically the version of a template that's been most recently reviewed and approved for use, depending on your workflow. It isn't necessarily the latest version of a template. Push Template The push notification template to use for the message. SMS Template The SMS template to use for the message. Voice Template The voice template to use for the message. This object isn't supported for campaigns. In App Template The In App template to use for the message. The In App template object is not supported for Send Messages.
