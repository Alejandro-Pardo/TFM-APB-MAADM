Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. The following operations are related to Create Multipart Upload: Parameters: ACL: The canned ACL to apply to the object. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined AC Ls, known as canned AC Ls. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see Canned ACL in the Amazon S3 User Guide. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When uploading an object, you can grant access permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the new object. For more information, see Using AC Ls. One way to grant the permissions using the request headers is to specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. | Bucket: The name of the bucket where the multipart upload is initiated and where the object is uploaded. Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3 (for example, amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Access points - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form Access Point Name-Account Id.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SD Ks, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point AR Ns, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form Access Point Name-Account Id.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User Guide. | Cache Control | Content Disposition | Content Encoding: Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field. | Content Language | Content Type | Expires | Grant Full Control: Specify access permissions explicitly to give the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the object. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When uploading an object, you can use this header to explicitly grant access permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups. This header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: id --- if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account uri --- if you are granting permissions to a predefined group emailAddress --- if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account I Ds permissions to read object data and its metadata: x-amz-grant-read: id=\"11112222333\", id=\"444455556666\" | Grant Read: Specify access permissions explicitly to allow grantee to read the object data and its metadata. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When uploading an object, you can use this header to explicitly grant access permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups. This header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: id --- if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account uri --- if you are granting permissions to a predefined group emailAddress --- if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account I Ds permissions to read object data and its metadata: x-amz-grant-read: id=\"11112222333\", id=\"444455556666\" | Grant Read ACP: Specify access permissions explicitly to allows grantee to read the object ACL. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When uploading an object, you can use this header to explicitly grant access permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups. This header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When uploading an object, you can use this header to explicitly grant access permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups. This header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

Directory buckets - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) ( AES256) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) ( aws:kms). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your Create Session requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads. In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except Copy Object and Upload Part Copy) using the REST API, the encryption request headers must match the encryption settings that are specified in the Create Session request. You can't override the values of the encryption settings ( x-amz-server-side-encryption, x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, x-amz-server-side-encryption-context, and x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled) that are specified in the Create Session request. You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the Create Session request to protect new objects in the directory bucket. S3 access points for Amazon F Sx - When accessing data stored in Amazon F Sx file systems using S3 access points, the only valid server side encryption option is aws:fsx. All Amazon F Sx file systems have encryption configured by default and are encrypted at rest. Data is automatically encrypted before being written to the file system, and automatically decrypted as it is read. These processes are handled transparently by Amazon F Sx. | Storage Class: By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. For more information, see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3 User Guide. | Website Redirect Location: If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. | SSE Customer Algorithm: Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, AES256). | SSE Customer Key: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header. | SSE Customer Key MD5: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the customer-provided encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error. | SSEKMS Key Id: Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption. If the KMS key doesn't exist in the same account that's issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key ID. General purpose buckets - If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption with aws:kms or aws:kms:dsse, this header specifies the ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) of the KMS key to use. If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms or x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms:dsse, but do not provide x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key ( aws/s3) to protect the data. Directory buckets - To encrypt data using SSE-KMS, it's recommended to specify the x-amz-server-side-encryption header to aws:kms. Then, the x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id header implicitly uses the bucket's default KMS customer managed key ID. If you want to explicitly set the x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id header, it must match the bucket's default customer managed key (using key ID or ARN, not alias). Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 customer managed key per directory bucket's lifetime. The Amazon Web Services managed key ( aws/s3) isn't supported. Incorrect key specification results in an HTTP 400 Bad Request error. | SSEKMS Encryption Context: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption. The value of this header is a Base64 encoded string of a UTF-8 encoded JSON, which contains the encryption context as key-value pairs. Directory buckets - You can optionally provide an explicit encryption context value. The value must match the default encryption context - the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional encryption context value is not supported. | Bucket Key Enabled: Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with server-side encryption using Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). General purpose buckets - Setting this header to true causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS. Also, specifying this header with a PUT action doesn't affect bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key. Directory buckets - S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for GET and PUT operations in a directory bucket and can't be disabled. S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through Copy Object, Upload Part Copy, the Copy operation in Batch Operations, or the import jobs. In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object. | Request Payer: Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester Pays enabled, the requester will pay for corresponding charges to copy the object. For information about downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide. | Tagging: The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query parameters. | Object Lock Mode: Specifies the Object Lock mode that you want to apply to the uploaded object. | Object Lock Retain Until Date: Specifies the date and time when you want the Object Lock to expire. | Object Lock Legal Hold Status: Specifies whether you want to apply a legal hold to the uploaded object. | Expected Bucket Owner | Checksum Algorithm | Checksum Type",
