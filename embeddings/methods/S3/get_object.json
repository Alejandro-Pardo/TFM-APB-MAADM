For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg, specify the object key name as /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For a path-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named examplebucket, specify the object key name as /examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For more information about request types, see HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Directory buckets - Only virtual-hosted-style requests are supported. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3, specify the object key name as /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. Also, when you make requests to this API operation, your requests are sent to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ``https://bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name ``. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class, the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier, or the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive Access tier, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using Restore Object. Otherwise, this operation returns an Invalid Object State error. For information about restoring archived objects, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Directory buckets - Directory buckets only support EXPRESS_ONEZONE (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and ONEZONE_IA (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones. Unsupported storage class values won't write a destination object and will respond with the HTTP status code 400 Bad Request. Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for the Get Object requests, if your object uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3), server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS). If you include the header in your Get Object requests for the object that uses these types of keys, you'll get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error. Directory buckets - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. There are times when you want to override certain response header values of a Get Object response. For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value through your Get Object request. You can override values for a set of response headers. These modified response header values are included only in a successful response, that is, when the HTTP status code 200 OK is returned. The headers you can override using the following query parameters in the request are a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the Get Object response are Cache-Control, Content-Disposition, Content-Encoding, Content-Language, Content-Type, and Expires. To override values for a set of response headers in the Get Object response, you can use the following query parameters in the request.

Directory buckets - The HTTP Host header syntax is Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. The following operations are related to Get Object: Parameters: Bucket: The bucket name containing the object. Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3 (for example, amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Access points - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form Access Point Name-Account Id.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SD Ks, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point AR Ns, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Object Lambda access points - When you use this action with an Object Lambda access point, you must direct requests to the Object Lambda access point hostname. The Object Lambda access point hostname takes the form Access Point Name-Account Id.s3-object-lambda.*Region*.amazonaws.com. S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form Access Point Name-Account Id.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User Guide. | If Match: Return the object only if its entity tag (E Tag) is the same as the one specified in this header; otherwise, return a 412 Precondition Failed error. If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in the request as follows: If-Match condition evaluates to true, and; If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested. For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232. | If Modified Since: Return the object only if it has been modified since the specified time; otherwise, return a 304 Not Modified error. If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as follows: `` If-None-Match`` condition evaluates to false, and; If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified status code. For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232. | If None Match: Return the object only if its entity tag (E Tag) is different from the one specified in this header; otherwise, return a 304 Not Modified error.

This value is used to decrypt the object when recovering it and must match the one used when storing the data. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header. If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers: x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. | SSE Customer Key MD5: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the customer-provided encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

For more information, see Using Requester Pays buckets for storage transfers and usage in the Amazon Simple Storage Service user guide. | Replication Status: Amazon S3 can return this if your request involves a bucket that is either a source or destination in a replication rule. | Parts Count: The count of parts this object has. This value is only returned if you specify partNumber in your request and the object was uploaded as a multipart upload. | Tag Count: The number of tags, if any, on the object, when you have the relevant permission to read object tags. | Object Lock Mode: The Object Lock mode that's currently in place for this object. | Object Lock Retain Until Date: The date and time when this object's Object Lock will expire. | Object Lock Legal Hold Status: Indicates whether this object has an active legal hold.
